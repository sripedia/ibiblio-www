He strongly disagreed with
Mayaavaada of Sankara . He was a pragmatic person , who fought the pessimism of
the times (Thirteenth Century) with the development of a Vedantic System of his
own drawing inspiration from the " Buoyant realism of the <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Vedas.html" class=wikipagelink>Vedas</a>, The
transcendental theism of the <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Upanishads.html" class=wikipagelink>Upanishads</a> and the emotional theism of the epics
and Puranas ."He installed a beautiful Archa of Sri Krishna at Uduppi and
imposed the rigorous observance fo fasts on Ekadasis. He held to the view that
the soul of man is potentially divine (Aprameyaeh Iswara svarupatvaat), but man
in the ignorance of his true status, has so much lost his soul to his body and
its cravings that he requires to be roused from his Avidya nidra by God himself
or by His great messengers from time to time.
<p>
He was a prolific writer, particularly in Sanskrit. His favorite Vedam is Rg
Vedam.  He wrote a commentary on it. His favorite Upanishad is Aitreyam. He has
been distinguished by his great dependence on Rg Veda compared to other
Vedantins. He can be very poetical at times . He was a mystic, logician and
skilled in handling of dialectical subtelities.In his commentary on Aitreya
Upanishad, his mystic nature helps him to pour out his sentiments on the
eternal glory and majesty of Vishnu . He says: " the voice of clouds, the music
of the spheres, the fury of the winds, the roar of the waves of the ocean, the
names of the Gods and Sages are the names of the supreme and voice HIS eternal
glory and majesty."
<p>
He left us 37 works. 31 of them are major works, the rest being stotras and
miscellaneous works. Among major works, the commentaries on the Prasthaana
Trayi , Bhashyas on ten major upanishads, Rg Veda and Bhagavata Puraana and
Maha Bharatha are important testimony to his erudition and depth. He strongly
believed that the "divided allegiance between Saguna and Nirguna is not
conducive to sincerity of thought or belief."He identified the Brahman of
Vedanta with VISHNU . He pointed out that the Advaitic canvas has a
significant content regarding Saguna Brahman.He showed that the failure of the
Godless ritualism of the Purva Mimaamsaa and the agnosticism of the Samkhya
were conclusive proofs that the development of philosophy without inclusion of
theism had no chance for survival. He has opined that the "acceptance " &amp;
establishment of the ShaN Mathaas Adi Sankara is a standing proof of the
inevitable reign of religion in contemproary philosophy. The strong devotional
traditions of the Haridasa Kuta centered around Udipi and Karnataka , the cult
of devotion for Viththalaa in Maharashtra, the literary works of distinguished
Dasas like Sripaada Raja, Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa, Vyasa Raja, Gopala
Dasa,and Vadhi Raja(the great Hayagriva Upasakar) reached all classes and
communities especially in Karnataka. This Haridasa movement placed a rich menu
of religion and morality before the Kaandigas and others.  It preached the
philosophy of Naishkarmya, as intrepreted by Madhvaacharya, that the
enlightened action in a spirit of devotion and dedication to God is a central
theme in the Sad Darsanas of India, where the ideal of Moksha dominates as the
ulitmate goal of Humans .
