day . It is also a day of feasting for the eyes of almost two laks 
of devotees of Seluva Naarayana , the presiding deity of the ancient 
temple at the sleepy town of Melkote . These devotees assemble at 
Melkote  known also as Thirunarayana Puram on this day 
for having the darsan of their Lord adorning the legendary 
diamond-studded crown , the Vaira Mudi . Seluva Narayana adorns 
this ancient crown presented by  Lord Krishna Himself on this night 
and is taken in procession around the main streets around the temple 
until the wee hours of the morning . People position themselves
at every vantage point to have the sacred darsan of the Lord 
adorning the Vaira Mudi , while seated on a golden Garudan 
with His divine consorts . Tradition has it that anyone , who has 
the good fortune of worshipping the Lord in person on this occasion 
will be freed from all their sins and will recieve the special blessings of 
Seluva Narayanan. 
<p>
The legend also has it that the Vaira Mudi was the crown worn by 
Sriman Narayana at His abode at the Milky ocean ; it was stolen by 
Virochana , the son of Bhaktha Prahlada , when the Lord was 
sleeping . Virochana ran away to the nether world with the stolen
crown of the Lord and hid there . Garuda was requested later by 
the devotees of the Lord to go after Virochana and recover 
the Vaira Mudi . Garuda descended to the nether world , fought 
with Virochana , defeated him , recovered his Lord's crown 
and was flying back to his Lord's abode , when he saw child Krishna 
playing in the mid day heat with His  friends at Brindhavan . Garuda
spread his wings over his Master , the young Krishna to provide shade 
and then placed the Vaira Mudi on the head of Lord Krishna .
Local legend states that Lord Krishna came later to Thirunarayana 
Puram from Dwaraka and presented the Vaira Mudi to Seluva Narayanan.
<p>
Based on the temple traditions , Vaira Mudi is not to be seen in day light .
Hence , it is brought to Thirunarayana Puram from Mandya District treasury 
on the  day of the festival in a special casket shielded from the Sun's rays . 
There is special police protection for this casket during its journey 
from Mandya treasury to the temple at Melkote and back on this day . 
When the casket containing Vaira Mudi arrives at the boundaries of the town ,
it is recieved with temple honors and brought to the temple on a special
palanquin  . The sacred crown arrives at the temple around 5.30 PM . 
It rests in front of Acharya Ramanuja's sanctum for another four hours.
Here , the Lord Seluva Narayanan is fitted with the Vaira Mudi by 
the temple priest  before the adoring eyes of Acharya Ramanuja . 
No one can see the Vaira Mudi until the Lord adorns it . Hence ,the officiating
priest covers his eyes with a silk garment , lifts the Vaira Mudi from 
the casket and places it on the Lord's head as a part of the coronation 
ceremony . Now the procession starts and lasts until the early hours of
the morning of the next day .The majesty of this festival is matchless .
The quiet town of Melkote comes to life during this special festival.
<p>
Lord Seluva Narayanan   is the darling child or Sella Pillai of AchArya 
Ramanuja , who arrived at Melkote , when he was 82 years young 
and stayed for 12 long years at Melkote worshipping the Lord . 
Seluva Narayanan is also known as Rama Priyan since He was 
worshipped by Lord Ramachandra during His incarnation as 
the son of King Dasaratha .
<p>
Thirunarayana Puram (Melkote) has a sacred temple on the hill 
for Lord Narasimha consecrated by Prahlada . Many Vaishnavite 
Acharyas like Nanjeeyar and the first Jeeyar of Ahobila Mutt were born 
here . A famous Sanskrit Acdaemy is located at Melkote and has
its research center in sylvan settings not too far from the temple .
Melkote is also famous for a local sweet preparation named 
Melkote Manoharam , the sacred white clay used by Vaishnavas 
on their foreheads , Ulundurai , a variation on the traditional
Pongal using black gram and special handloom clothings .
Many Hoysala Temples are within driving distance of Melkote
and have enduring links to the times , when Acharya Ramanuja
stayed in Karnataka desam .
