<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
This sanskrit hymn is found in the Mahabharata and is 
part of Bhisma's response to Yudisthara's request
for advise on the best way to attain lasting happiness,
peace of mind and relief from bondage.
<p>
This is a simple word for word translation and was
put together to understand the actual cadence
and literal meaning of the verses so as to better 
appreciate the deep philosophical meanings they
represent and the commentaries written by others.
<p>
It draws heavily from the write ups of N. Krishnamachari
and the English translations of Sri Bhattar's commentary 
and Sri Sankara's commentary.

<b>Errors</b>
<p>
Condensing the rich and deep concepts into a simple word 
for word translation required making numerous compromises
which most certainly has led to errors, so please read 
with caution and please <a href="/sripedia/contact.html">report</a> any errors found.
