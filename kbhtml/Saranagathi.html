<H3><a name="The_Importance_of_SaraNAgathi"></a>1. The Importance of SaraNAgathi</H3>

<p>
The doctrine of SaraNAgathi constitutes the most important subject of Sri VaishNavA religion. The concept of SaraNAgathi in the sense of  seeking  God  or some other higher being as the sole refuge is universally accepted in all religions. All Other religions  except Sri  VaishNavA religion do not admit SaraNAgathi as a direct means (upAyA) to MOkshA or the liberation of the soul from  bondage.  In this  context,  the  Upanishads  mention  explicitly gn~AnA in the sense of intutive knowledge of Brahman or the vision of God is the direct means to attain the supreme goal (parama  -  purushArtham). Thus  says the TaittirIya Upanishad: "Brahmavid ApnOti param" (The knower of Brahman attains  Brahman).  The  SvEtasvatAra  Upanishad comments    more    specifically:    "Having    known   Him,   the Parama-Purushan, an  individual  transgresses  human  bondage  and there are no other means to attain Him. The Upanishads also enjoin nididhyAsanA, also known as UpAsanA, and Bhakthi YOgA or unceasing meditation  on  God  as the direct means for the attainment of the supreme goal. Thus says the BrahadAraNyaka Upanishad: "Verily, the Self (Brahman) is to be seen,to be heard,to be reflected on and to be meditated  upon  ".  The  terms  (seen,  heard,  reflected  on, meditated upon) are all synonymous as explained by Sri RamAnujA in his  Sri  BhAshyA. The Upanishads thus appear to teach that direct sAdhanA or means to attain God is UpAsanA or Bhakthi YOgA. 
<p>
<H3><a name="Is_SaraNAgathi_sanctioned_by_Scriptures"></a>2. Is SaraNAgathi sanctioned by Scriptures ?</H3>

<p>
Against  this  general  background  provided  by  the  Upanishadic teachings, the question arises whether SaraNAgathi also  known  as Prapatthi or total surrender of one self to God as the sole refuge could  serve  as the direct means for MOkshAm. Right from the time of AlvArs, all the VaishNava  AchAryAs  have  accepted  it  as  an alternative   direct  means  to  MOkshAm  (SAkshAth  mokshOpAyam). Questions have been raised as to the justification of  SaraNAgathi as  a  direct  means  to  MOkshA  from  the standpoint of VedAntha sUthrAs, since this practise appears to be  a  non-vedic  practise without  the  support of scriptural texts accepted by the orthodox tradition. The objection to SaraNAgathi  from  these  quarters  is that it is a contentional dogma accepted on faith only. This is an objection  raised  by  the  followers of other schools of VedAnthA need to be answered in order to understand  the  significance  and importance of SaraNAgathi as a direct means to MOkshA.This article is  devoted to address these issues raised by the other schools of VedAnthA. 
<p>
<H3><a name="What_is_Prapatthi"></a>3. What is Prapatthi ?</H3>

<p>
Prapatthi is a Vedic doctrine which is fully sanctioned  not  only by   the   scriptural   texts  Sruti,  which  includes  VedAs  and Upanishads,  but  also  by  Smruthi  texts,  which   include   the IthihAsAs, PurANAs and the AgamAs. As will be explained later, the VaishNava  AchAryAs  have  advocated  Prapatthi  as an alternative means  for  MOkshA  intended  for  two  different  categories   of individuals   with   different   capacities   and   conditions  of eligibilities (adhikAri-bhEda). 
<p>
<H3><a name="Bhakthi_and_Prapatthi_YOgAs"></a>4. Bhakthi and Prapatthi YOgAs</H3>

<p>
According to VisishtAdvaita VedAnthA, Bhakthi yOgA  and  Prapatthi yOgA  are  the  two  important  sAdhanAs (means) for achieving the Supreme  Spiritual  goal  (parama  -   purushArthA).   While   the Upanishads  have  laid more emphasis on UpAsanA, which is the same as Bhakthi yOgA, the VaishNavA  treatises  have  accorded  greater prominence  to  Prapatthi.  Both have been sanctioned by the Sruti and Smruti texts and they have been advocated as meeting the needs of distinctly different categories of  adhikAries  with  different capabilities  and  conditions  of  eligibility.  Bhakthi YOgA is a rigorous sAdhanA and  is  thus  restricted  to  certain  class  of individuals.On  the  other  hand,  Prapatthi  is recommended as an easier to practise path intended for all without any  restrictions of  caste,  creed  and  status of individuals.In view of this, the VaishNava AchAryAs right from the time  of  NAthamuni  have  given preference  to  Prapatthi  and advocated it as the easier means to MOkshA.  Prapatthi  has,   therefore   assumed   significance   in VaishNavism. 
<p>
<H3><a name="Meaning_of_the_term_Prapatthi"></a>5. Meaning of the term Prapatthi</H3>

<p>
The  term  Prapatthi  is  derived from the root words Pra-Pad; Pad means to move on and Pra  implies  in  the  best  manner.  In  the context of the UpAya, the term implies total self-surrender to God as the sole refuge. A more appropriate Sanskrit term for Prapatthi is  Athma-nikshEpA  or  BharAnyAsA, that is to place the burden of protection of the Self in the care of the God.It is also known  as SaraNAgathi  or  seeking  God  as the sole refuge.We shall explain later the nature of Prapatthi, its various components, the  method of  observance and its other important features.For now , we shall focus on how this doctrine is rooted in the VedAs, Upanishads  and the post-Vedic treatises. 
<p>
<H3><a name="Antiquity_of_the_Doctrine"></a>6. Antiquity of the Doctrine</H3>

<p>
Prapatthi  as a doctrine is a very ancient one with its deep roots in the vEdAs.  There  are  numerous  statements  in  the  Rg  vEdA referring  to  the  basic principle of SaraNAgathi., viz., that an individual pleading his inability  to  achieve  a  desired  object seeks  with  fervent  prayer the help of a divine power. The Vedic seers were fully conscious of the fact that none  other  than  the Divine  Being  is  capable  of  protecting  man  from the ocean of bondage (na hi tvadanyah puruhUta kasccana: Rg vedam  VIII.66.13). God  is  regarded  as a dear friend and near relative of all human beings (tvam jAmir janAnAm agnE mithrO asi priyah, sakhA sakhibhya Idyah..Rg Vedam I.75.4). He is compared to the non-leaky boat that can safely take persons from one shore to the other,  through  the turbulent  waters  of  life  (dhaivIm  nAvam  svaraithrAm anAgasam asravanthIm a ruhEma svastayE : Rg Vedam X.63.10). The Vedic seers have, therefore, sought in all their prayers the grace of God  for achieving their desired objectives. 
<p>
We  shall  cite  one  important hymn of the Rg VedA, which is also reiterated in the IsAvAsyOpanishad that contains the reference  to SaraNAgathi.  This  hymn  addressed  to  Agni  reads:  "agnE  naya supathArAye     asmAn     visvAni     deva     vayunAni    vidvAn; yuyodhy-asmaj-jhurANameno bhUishtAm te nama  ukthim  vidhema"  (Rg Vedam:  I.189.1).  This  rk  means:  "O  Agni!  lead  us along the auspicious path to prosperity, O God, who  knowest  the  means  of attainment,  remove  all the obstacles coming in our way; we shall offer  unto  Thee  salutation  with  the  expression  of   namah". According to the intrepretation of Swami Desikan, Agni in the hymn refers  to  the  Supreme  Being  as  its  antharAthmA and the word "namah" signifies the act of self-surrender to God.  Another  hymn states  explicitly  that  the  person,  who offers prayer with the expression of "namah" (implying self-surrender) is to be  regarded as  one,  who  has  performed  a good sacrifice (sOdhvarah) almost equal to the formal sacrifice done  in  the  consecrated  fire  by offering  the  faggots  (samith)  along with the recitation of the mantrAs (yah samidha ya Ahuti yo  vedena  dadAsa  marto  agnayE;yo namasA  svadhvarah..Rg Vedam VIII.19.5). The interpretaion of this hymn in favor of self-surrender (Athma-nyAsa)  is  upheld  by  the Ahirbhudhnya SamhitA XXXVII.37 (samit sAdhanAkAdinAm) 
<p>
The Upanishads have given expression in clearer terms to Prapatthi as  an upAyam for MOkshA.Thus, the SvEtAsvatara Upanishad says: "I as an aspirant of MOkshA seek refuge in that  effulgent  God,  who crates  BrahmA first and who verily delivers to him the VedAs, etc (yO brahmaNAnam vidadhAti pUrvam-- --  mumukshur-vai  saraNam-aham prapdhyE)".   The  Taittiriya  NArayaNa  Upanishad  extolls  nyAsA (Prapatthi) and enjoins that the  Self  is  to  be  surrenderd  to Brahman  with  the  praNava  manthram  (tasmAn-nyAsamEshAm tapasAm Atiritam-Ahuh....brahmaNE tvA mahasa Om-iti-AtmAnam yunjita: TN Up -147.8). The Kathavalli Sruthi, which is not extant but frequently referred to by  Swami  Desikan  and  other  VaishNavite  AchAryAs, contains  the  rahaya  manthram known as dhvayam, which enunciates the essence of SaraNAgathi. Thus, there is full Vedic support  for the doctrine of SaraNAgathi.
