<H3><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</H3>

Srimath <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Ramayana.html" class=wikipagelink>RAmAyaNA</a> and MahA BharathA are two great epics (ithihAsAs) that  are  like two resplendent pillars of the Hindu dharmA and culture. Of these two, MahA BharathA  is  a  mighty  monumental  work  that enshrines  the  essence of DharmA in all its aspects. All the four purushArthAs  are  expounded  elaborately  in  this  great   work. "Whatever is here may be found elsewhere, but whatever is not here is  not to be found anywhere". This praise is not an exaggeration, but a statement of fact. 
<p>
The theme of MahA BhArathA: The  MahA  BharathA  presents  in  one place  the internal as well as external nature of our culture, the aspirations of humanity and the achievements and goals of life  in an   inimitable  way.  It  contains  the  wisdom  of  the  VedhAs, VedhAngAs, and all SAsthrAs and one can easily  get  to  know  the quintessence of all of the above through a study of this epic. 
<p>
The  loftiness  of MahA BhArahtA: This has been the source text to all poets that flourished further in Bharatha desam. MahA BhArathA has been assigned a lofty place, which is equal to the vEdhAs  and is called the panchama (fifth) vEdhA because its subject matter in the ultimate analysis is the same as that of the vEdhAs. 
<p>
<H3><a name="The_date_of_MahA_BhArathA"></a>2. The  date  of  MahA  BhArathA</H3>

MahA  BhArathA  has  been  studied intensively by various scholars.  From  those  studies,  Professor Sukthankar  has  published  what  is  considered  as  one  of  the authentic  version  of  the epic based on the careful study of the many rescensions of MahA BhArathA. His work is considered by  some as  a  significant  landmark  in the study of this epic. It is the opinion of some scholars that the present day MahA BhAratham  went through  three stages known as "JayA, BharathA and MahA BhArathA". It has been pointed out that a number of stories were added to the original poem during the successive centuries (from 400 B.C to 400 A.D)leading upto its final form consisting of  one  lakh  slOkams. Tradition  recognizes  the whole work as one integrated piece. 
<p>
<H3><a name="The_three_stages_of_the_evolution_of_MahA_BhArathA"></a>3. The three stages of the evolution of MahA BhArathA</H3>

The  core  of  the MahA  BhArathA ideals with the defeat in the battle of KauravAs at the hands of the PAndavAs. Later on,  the  entire  story  of  "the BharathA  race"  came  to  be  associated  with  this  in  all its elaboration. The epic was called "JayA" because it  describes  the story  of  the  victory  of the PAndavAs over the KauravAs. It was called "BharathA" since it dealt with the lives of the  people  of the  BharathA race. It was called MahA BharathA or IthihAsA, since it recorded the chronicles of the monarchs of those  times.  First stage  was  the  JayA  stage.  This  consisted  of 8800 slOkAs and related to the main theme of the work, namely,  the  feud  between KauravAs   and   the   PANdavAs.   This  portion  contains  poetic descriptions relevant to such a narration. 
<p>
The second stage Of "BharathA" evolved with the  addition  of  the greatness  of  the  personages involved in the family war. At this stage, the epic had 24,000 sOkams. It contained the description of the glory of personages like BhIshmA, DhrONA, the stories relating to the birth of the KauravAs and the PANdavAs, their education and upbringinging, the virtues of the royal class,  the  troubles  and travails  of  the  PANdavAs  during  their  period  of  exile  and particularly  the  one  year  of  living incognito in the court of VirAtA, the efforts made to prevent the great war, the teaching of KrishNA to ArjunA, the description of  the  war  that  lasted  for eighteen days and the final victory gained by the PANdavAs. All of these  topics  relating  directly  to  the main theme were perhaps added on in  the  second  stage  known  as  BharathA  with  24,000 slOkams.  During the third and final stage, a number of upAkhyAnAs (other stories and anecdotes) were added on to this great work  to make  it,  "MahA BhArathA". The size swelled upto 100,000 slOkams. In this form, MahA BhArathA became an  encyclopedia  of  Knowledge and   wisdom  of  humanity.  The  VishNu  SahasranAmam,  AnugIthA, Bhishma-sthavam, GajEndhra Moksham et  al  were  added.  Long  and elaborate stories of DushyanthA and SakunthalA, SAvithri-SatyavAn, YayAthi,  RAmA,  MathsyOpAkhyAnA, Shibi chakravarthy, the story of NaLa-Dhamayanthi have been added as major upAkhyAnams and the bulk of these constitutes nearly one fourth of this great work. 
<p>
In  the  northern  rescension  of  MahA BhAratham, there are 82136 stanzas  and  the  southern  rescension  has  96586  stanzas.  The description of the war is another significant feature of this work and this comprises one  fifth  of  MahA  BhAratham.  Finally,  the teaching  about  DharmA  occupies the most prominent place in this ithihAsam. The ShAnthi parvam is totally devoted to  the  teaching on  DharmA. The teachings about Bhagavadh GitA, RAja dharmA, Apath dharmA, Moksha dharmA, the dhArmic teachings housed in AnusAsAsana parvA constiture together one third of MahA BhAratham. In addition to the 18 parvAs of MahA Bharatham, there is another  parvA  known as  Hari  vamsam,  which is considered a "khila or anubhandA or an addition to the main text". This has a lot of focus on DharmA  and contains 317 cantos and more than 16,000 stanzas. 
<p>
<H3><a name="The_structure_of_MahA_BhAratham"></a>4. The structure of MahA BhAratham</H3>

There are 18 parvAs  in  MB. These  are  :  (1)  Adhi  parvA (2) SabhA parvA (3) Vana parvA (4) VirAt parvA (5) UdhyOga parvA (6) Bhishma parvA (7) DhrONa parvA (8) Karna parvA (9) Shalya parvA (10) Soupthika parvA  (11)  Sthree parvA  (12)  ShAnthi  parvA  (13) AnusAsana parvA (14) AsvamEdhika parvA   (15)   AsramavAsi   parvA   (16)   Mousala   parvA    (17) MahAprasthAnika parvA and (18) SvargArOhaNa parvA. 
<p>
It is not clear when  this kind of division into parvAs took place. The parvAs are of different length and there is  no  uniformity  regarding  their size.  The  shortest  is MahAprasthAnika parvA containing only 120 stanzas, whereas the longest is ShAnthi parvA. The combination  of ShAnthi  parvA  and  AnushAsana  parvA  yields 21,000 stanzas. The themes of Individual Chapters of  MB:  The  Adhi  parvA  gives  an elaborate  description  of  the  lunar  race  and the birth of the PaNDavAs. The SabhA parvA deals with the game  of  dice  to  which YudhishtirA was invited. The Vana parvA deals with the experiences of  the PaNDavAs in the forest and the VirAta parvA narrates their stay in VirAta nagaram in cognito. In UdhyOga parvA, Lord  KrishNA goes to HasthinApuri as a messenger of peace. BhIshma parvA houses Srimadh  Bhagavath  GitA,  the  commencement of the war, BhIshmA's participation in it  and  the  defeat  of  BhIshmA.  DhrONa  parvA narrates  the  death of Abhimanyu and the death of DhrONA himself. KarNa parvA is devoted to the war that was waged by KarNA and  his death.  Shalya  parvA deals with the role played by ShalyA and the death of  DuryOdhanA.  Souptika  parva  dscribes  the  slaying  by AsvatthAman of the children of PANDavAs, while they were sleeping. Sthree  parvA  is full of lamentataions of the bereaved women. The teaching of the DharmA to  YudhishtrA  by  BhIshmAchAryAl  is  the subject  matter  of ShAnthi parvA. Anushasasana parvA has accounts of  the  stories  relating  to  morals  and   righteousness.   The performance  of  AsvamEdha  YAgam is described in AsvamEdha parvA. The AsramavAsi parvA narrates how DhritarashtrA retires  into  the woods  for  performance of penance and Mausala parvA narrates the destruction of the YAdhavAs. MahAprasthAnika parvA  describes  how the  PANDavAs set out on their final journey through the HimAlAyAs and the SvargArOhaNa parvA describes how they ascended to heaven.

<H3><a name="The_tradition_of_authorship"></a>5. The  tradition of authorship</H3>

According to tradition <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Veda_Vyasa.html" class=wikipagelink>Sage VyAsA</a> is the author of MahA BhAratham. He is the son of ParAsarA, who  gave us  VishNu  purAnam  and Sathyavathi. He was a contemproary to the events that happened in MahA BhAratham. The traditional salutation to VyAsA is: "I bow down  to  VyAsA,  the  son  of  ParAsarA,  the grandson  of Sakthi, the great grandson of VasishTA, the father of Sukha Brahmam of pure mind and who is full of the power of Tapas." The Message of MahA BhAratham: Its message to humanity is in three directions:  (1)  The  empirical  (2)  The  Moral  and   (3)   The Metaphysical.  At  the  empirical,  worldly level, it gives a real picture of the terrible war between the great heroes of the  times that  was  devastating. At the moral level, it points out that the war is an eternal one that is forever fought between the good  and the  evil  forces,  between dharmA and adharmA, between the Asuric and daivA ( satthvA) forces and assesses  the  ethics  of  such  a conflict.  At  the  metaphysical  level,  it  points  out that the embodied  one  has  to  strive  incessantly  to  go  beyond  these dualities of life destroying the darkness  of  delusion  with  the sword  of knowledge under the guidance of the internal controller, our Supreme Lord, KrishNA.
