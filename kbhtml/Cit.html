<H4>Types of Jiva</H4>

<p>
According to Vishishtadvaita Doctrines, the Jivans, which are infinite in
number are quite different from one another , based on their Karmic history.The
three types of Jivans are : Baddha, Mukta and Nitya Jivans.
<p>
BADDHA JIVAN OR SOULS IN BONDAGE: they are associated with bodies as a result
of unexpended Karmas from previous births The birth of the Jivans in the world
is due to Avidya or Nescience in them.  Avidya results from Karma. The repeated
performance of Karma by the Jivans leaves Vasana or the latent impressions in
their mind,which in turn generates Ruci or propensity to do or engage in an
act. This in turn leads to PrakrtiSambhanda or association with the Prakrti or
Body.  This embodiment causes further Avidya and consequent Karma.  Thus , all
of the above--Avidya, Karma , embodiment -- work in a cycle.  Each one is
influenced by the one that precedes it and is the cause of the other that
follows. This has been going on from time immemorial.  The law of Karma works
with relentless vigour and no one can escape its consequences. 
<p>
MUKTA JIVAN OR FREED SOUL: A Baddha Jiva , who by a study of the sastras at the
feet of a qualified Acharya acquires the correct knowledge about the nature of
the Body, Jivan, Achetana and Iswaran or Paramatman.  He or She then
experiences a desire for Moksha( Freedom from the cycles of Births and Deaths)
and becomes a Mumukshu. When at the end of earthly existence, such a person
casts the mortal coils and the Jivan travels the Arcvhiraadi Margam and reaches
Sri Vaikuntam and becomes an enjoyer of the bliss of Sri Vaikuntam and offers
eternal service to the Lord and His Consort. There , the Mukta Jivan associates
with the Nitya Suris on an equal footing and enjoys the bliss of Paramapadam.
<p>
NITYA JIVANS OR EVER FREE SOULS: Some examples of them are Garuda, Adi Sesha
and Vishvaksena. They as a class have not even a shadow of the touch of Karma,
and therefore have not been the victims of Samsara or the empirical world of
suffering.
<p>
The difference between the Nityas and Muktas is that the Mukta attained the
perfect bliss of residence in Vaikuntam and service to the Paramatman AT A
POINT IN TIME ,WHEREAS THE NITYAS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING IT FROM "
BEGINNINGLESS " TIME .
<p>
The Nityas are of two kinds. Bhaktas, who serve Paramatman directly and
Bhagavatas who serve the Bhaktas and thus serve the Supreme Lord indirectly.
Ananta , Garuda and Vishvaksena and the like belong to the first category and
the rest to the second Category. There are other Nityas who are not doing any
particular service. They behold the others serving the Lord and Bhagavata
Nityas with reverence and pride. There is no rivalry between the two
categories (ie) the Nitya Suris, the erstwhile Mukta, who joined the ranks of
Nityas serving the other Nityas and those, who are enjoying the bliss of
Vaikuntam without offering any kainkaryam directly or indirectly..
<p>
The Nityas occasionally come down to our world either with their Lord or by
themselves .If they do so, it is not because of the power of Karma, but by
their own will or at the behest of their Lord. They come down to assist and
continue the work of their Lord related to the redemption of the Baddha
Jivans. The Azhwars and the Acharyas are recognized as the incarnations of one
or other Nityas. When their work is over,they return to their home in Sri
Vaikuntam. When they are in this world,they behave like their Lord themselves
(ie) they are like human beings subject to the rules and restrictions, the
sorrows and sufferings of the world.They are however NOT the victims of
Karma. In their case, it is only the semblence of suffering on the stage of the
world like that of a consummate actor on the stage (Rangam). They undertake
this work on this earth to please their Supreme Lord.
<p>
The Muktas and Nityas differ from Iswaran in that they unlike their Lord are
not responsible for the creation , maintenance and destruction of this
universe. He and He alone has "Jagat Kaaranatvam ,Sarvesvaratvam, Vyapaktvam,
Sarva Seshitvam, Sarva Karma samaaraadhyatvam, Sarva Pala Pradhatvam,--- Svataa
Satyasankalpatvam ".  These are Isvara Lakshanams..
