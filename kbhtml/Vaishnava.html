Followers of Vaishnavism<a href="/action=edit&id=Vaishnavism" class=wikipageedit>?</a> are Vaishanavas. Vaishnavism is a broad-based
universal religion , which is open to one and all independent of Caste , creed,
gender, and scholarship of the individual. The qualifications to be a true
Vaishnava has been described beautifully by Narasimha Mehta in his song
"Vaishanava Jana Tho", a favorite of Mahatma Gandhi.There are prescribed
religious duties for Sri Vaishnavas.(Vaishnavas and Sri Vaishnavas are equal in
meaning. The word Sri is added for auspiciousness in the Vaishnava
Paribhasha(Colloquliasm) . It is also a matter of respect accorded by others to
Vaishnavas.

<H3><a name="Origins_of_the_term"></a>2. Origins of the term</H3>

(1)The name Vishanvam is of Vedic origin .
<p>
The name is referred to in Rg Vedam first ,
the oldest of VedAs .The exact quotation 
is "Gaam gathasya tava dhAma VaishNavam ".
The effulgence of the Lord ( Svayam Jyothi)
is being saluted here .He is param JyOthi .
<p>
(2)The nigantu explanation is " VishNurdEvathAsya 
tasyEdham vaa aNN) or that relates to VishNu .
<p>
(3)It is also the noun of the asterism "SravaNaa".
SravaNam is VishNu's constellation ( SravaNa VenkatEsan ).
Although SravaNa nakshthram is the celebrated 
constellation assoicated with Him , we have to remember 
the slOkam used by the AarAdhakar at Ahobila matam 
before ThiruvArAdhanam :
<p>
Thithir VishNus tathA vaara: 
Nakshathram VishNurEva cha 
yOgasccha karanam chaiva
SARVAM VISHNU MAYAM JAGATH 
<p>
<p>
(4)Vaishnavam also means the celestial residence of
MahA VishNu (i-e) VaikuNtam .
<p>
(5)Finally , VaishNavam means the ashes of a burnt
offering like in PurNAhUthi during a Vedic yAgam .
(see <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Rituals.html" class=wikipagelink>Rituals</a>) about those Yaagams , where cooked Havis 
is offered to Agni invoking devathAs , whose 
antharyAmi is MahA VishNu /Sriman naarAyaNA .
We are back to Veda sambhandham now .
<p>
Vaishnavam can not be understood without 
knowing about VaishNava lakshaNam .That is
a deep subject

Sri Vaishnavas can come from any caste (e.g) Alvars. Kulasekara was a
Kshatruiya. Thirumangai was also a Kshatriya by birth. Nammalwar was not a
Brahmin. Thirumazhisai Alwar was a Siva Worshipper earlier. Thondaradipodi,
Periyalwar were Brahmins. The common things that tie them are the observance of
the sacraments of Vaishnavism and the observance of the religious duties of
Vaishnavas.DR.S.M.S.Chari"s well-written book "Vaishnavism, Its philosophy,
theology and religious discipline" will be very helpful to you to gain a
perspective on the details of Vaishnavism. Chapters 8 and 13 are brilliant
summaries of two important doctrines of Vaishnavism. Chapter 8 deals with
Vishnu and Goddess Sri. Chapter 13 deals with the important subject of Prapatti.
<p>
<H3><a name="Two_types_of_worship_by_vaishnavas"></a>4. Two types of worship by vaishnavas</H3>

<p>
Bhagavat Kainkarya and Bhagavata Kainkarya are the two types of worship. The
first is the service to the Lord without expectation of rewards(Nishkama Karma
described in Bhagavat Gita.) The Panchakala Prikriya or the five fold daily
religious duties can be folded in to the Bhagavat Kainkarya. 
<p>
The second type of Kainkarya is known as Bhagavata Kainkaryam or service to
Godly men and women.Bhagavata Kainkarya is recognized as one of the supreme
virtues of a true Vaishnava. The reasoning is as follows: True devotees of
Vishnu (the Bhagavatas) are very dear to the supreme Lord, Vishnu(Sriman
Narayana). Any service rendered to his dear Bhagavatas are therefore most
pleasing to Vishnu. DR. Chari has quoted in support of this view a passage from
Padmottara Purana:" Of all the types of worship, the worship to Vishnu is great;
Greater than that is the service to Bhagavatas." Service to Bhagavatas can take
many forms: providing food, shelter, clothing et al.Bhagavata apachara or
offence to Bhagavatas is to be avoided at all costs, since, it brings the wrath
of Bhagavan.

<p>
Out of his infinite mercy, Acharya Ramanauja has suggested 5 Kainkaryas to suit
the competence and convineience of the Vaishanvas; (1) study of Sri Bhashya, the
commentary on Brahma Sutras (2) for those, who find it difficult, study of the
Naalaiyra Divya Prabhandam (3) for those , who can not do that, services to
Vaishnava divya desams and Abhimana sthalas thru provision of Food, Flowers or
lighting of lamps (4) For those, who can not afford that the mantra Japa of
Dwayam, the sacred Mantram on Narayana and Sri Devi. (5) For those, who feel
they can not follow any one of the above four Kainkaryas, The company of
Vaishnavas is recommended as a last resort. Ramanuja's prescriptions cover the
entire world of Literate scholars in Sanskrit and Tamil as well as illiterate
masses, who have embraced Vaishnavism. No one is thus left out.
