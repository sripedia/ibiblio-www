The western intrepretation of dreams is quite different
than the Indian Intrepretation . If you have a Google search
on Dream analysis , you will get 100,000 plus hits on
Western approach to dream analysis . This will include
dictonaries on dreams etc.There are pundits , who make a living
on intrepreting people's dreams !
<p>
<H3><a name="Eastern_Analysis"></a>2. Eastern Analysis</H3>

Various <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Upanishads.html" class=wikipagelink>Upanishads</a> have taken up the state of Dream
and reveal powerful truths about the happenings in dreams .
There are  four states : Wakefulness ( Jaagaratha ) ,
Dream (Svapna) , Dreamless  sleep (Sushupthi) and
the Fourth(Thuriyaa). In the Sushupthi state , the jeevan
does not experience the agreeable and disagreeable objects
and returns to the embrace of ParamAthmaa . Dreamless
sleep(Sushupthi)  is a state that is free from all desires or sorrows .
<p>
The jeevan in the dreamless state has no contact with
punyaa or paapaa . This is supreme aanandham .
<p>
In the wakeful state, the jeevan engages in karmaas ;
in the dream state , the jeevan roams around seeing
the effects of the accumulated Paapam and PuNyam  and
<p>
after seeing their effects returns to the wakeful state .
<p>
The passages in BruhadhAraNyaka <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Upanishads.html" class=wikipagelink>Upanishad</a> that describe
the role of Jeevan , Indhriyams and ParamAthma are  brilliant
insights by our Maharishis .
<p>
Sage Yaj~nyavalkyA explains the dream state and the role of
one's karmAs -good and bad- and how ParamAthmA
ordains these dreams as Soochakams as well as rewards or
punishments for Sukruthams(Good Karmaas) and dhushkruthams
(Bad karmaas ) .
<p>
<H3><a name="Some_Passages_from_BruhadhAraNyakam"></a>3. Some Passages from BruhadhAraNyakam</H3>

<p>
1.There is this world ( Earth) , the other world
(Svargam , Sri Vaikuntam et al) and  a third world
(Dream world) in between the two worlds serving as
a junction between them .
<p>
2. The experiences in the dreams are linked to the Punyam
and Paapam that the Jeevan has accumulated and the Jeevan
experiences them with a body that is different form its physical
body in the awakened state ( Jaagrath state) . A different body
is assumed in the dream state . The  Jeevan having a new body
in the dream state can see this world as well as the other world.
<p>
3. In the dream state , one sees both plesant and unpleasant
things based on the substrate (aasraya) of Punyam or Paapam .
Objects are created by ParamAthman in the dream state based
on the individual jeevan's accumulated punyams and paapams
and their vaasanaas ( residual effects) . The Upanishads identify the Lord as the Sakala Prapancha NaaDaka SoothradhAran and He is therefore , the  karthaa of the dreams for the jeevans.
<p>
4. During the dream state , the jeevan makes the physical body
inactive and moves out of its usual resting place ( Heart cavity)
and moves about taking the sense organs with it . When the dream
is over , the Jeevan returns to its laya sthAnam .
<p>
3. The objects we see in the dreams are created by ParamAtman .
They are gone , when one wakes up.

<H3><a name="Dreams_in_Srimath_RaamAyaNam_amp_Dhivya_Prabhandham"></a>4. Dreams in <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Ramayana.html" class=wikipagelink>Srimath RaamAyaNam</a> &amp; Dhivya Prabhandham</H3>

Thirumangai Mannan's dream of NaacchiyAr KOil PerumAL
described in Periya Thirumozhi Paasurams and Andal's dream of
Her upcoming wedding with Lord RanganAthAn ( VaaraNam
aayiram paasurams of NaacchiyAr Thirumozhi) are good
referecnes in this context.
<p>
Our AchAryAs have studied extensively and cataloged
the dreams in unique  ways.  There is a book called
SvapnAdhyAyam that covers a lot of these dream analysis.
I do not know where you can get a copy in India .
<p>
If you wish to get a glimpse of the indications from dreams
you can refer to Thrijadai's dream at Lanka covered in
the 27th Sargam of Sundara KaaNDam of Srimath RaamAyaNam.
Thrijadai is the daughter of VibhIshaNan , who comforted
Sithai at AsOka Vanam .
<p>
I will quote two verses relating to the slOkams from
SvapnAdhyAyam here:
<pre>
aarOhaNam  gOvrusha kunjarANAm
prAsAdhasailaagra vanaspatheenAm
vishtAnulOpO  mrutham cha
svapnEshvagamyAgamanam cha dhanyam
</pre>
(Meaning ): When one dreams of traveling on the back of
Cow, Buffalo , Elephant or dream that they are ascending
the peak of a mountain , Tree or multistory building or
weeping or seeing one as dead or uniting with some one ,
who is not to be united with , these are said to be harbingers
of good tidings .
<p>
Here is slOkam 27.11 from Sundara KaaNDam about
Thrijadai's dream that makes reference to these
auspicous dream that she had  :
<pre>
Raaghavasccha mayaa dhrushta: chathurdhantham mahAgajam
aarODa: saila samkAsam chachAra sahalakshmaNa:
</pre>
(Meaning) : I saw Raaman seated with LakshmaNan
on a huge elephant(resembling a mountain ) with four
tusks and coming towards Sithai.
<p>
Thrijadai goes on and says:
<p>
I saw Sitha jumping on that elephant , sitting on
the lap of Her Lord and reaching with Her hands
towards the Moon  ( Sundara KaaNDam SlOkam 27.14).
<p>
The corrsponding SvapnAdhyAya slOkam is:
<pre>
aadhithya maNDalam vaapi chandra mandalam yeva vaa
svapnE gruhNAthi hasthAbhyAm mahath raajyam samApnuyAth
</pre>
(Meaning): The acquisition of a big kingdom is assured for
one , who dreams of reaches out and touches Chandra or
Soorya Mandalams.
<p>
Raama and VibhishaNa travel in the northerly direction
wearing white Vasthrams , which is auspicious. Wearing of
red or black vasthrams is inauspicious .
<p>
Thrijadai also dreams about her uncle , RaavaNan
in that same dream : RaavaNan is lying on ground ;
he is covered with gingely oil and is wearing red dress ;
he is obese and is weaing a garland of alari pushpams.
He is also seen by her as wearing black dress and with shaven
head driving a cart drawn by a donkey towards the southern direction .
These are all indicators of disastrous things that will happen , when 
dreamt.
Raavana experiences death at the hands of Lord Raamachandra.
<p>
<H3><a name="Auspicious_dreams_as_rewards_to_those_seeking_Moksha"></a>5. Auspicious dreams as rewards to those seeking Moksha </H3>

<p>
Nishkaama Karmaas alone does not grant you moksham .
It prepares you and purifies you to gain Moksham and increases 
your desire for Moksham and makes you a Mumukshu. It is
an attitude to develop and put it into practise for one's
liberation from SamsAric cycles  
<p>
The actual Moksha Siddhi is obtained thru the seeking a SadAchAryan
and performing SaraNAgathy ( UpAya anushtAnam) and living in 
a state of freedom from the fear of the afflictions of SamsAram .
<p>
Meanwhile , during our stay on earth until the physical body falls
down , we are not freed from performing Karmaas and the effects of
them will be rewarded with auspicious dreams by Sakala Prapancha
Naataka SoothradhAran , our Lord . The SaakshAthkAram of
dhivya dampathis in one's dream and particularly at Brahma Muhurtham
is a blissful experience to have .
<p>
Hence , persistence in doing NishkAma karmaas has no conflict 
with the aanandhAnubhavam of visualizing the Lord and His PirAtti 
in one's dreams . They are divine interventions and blessings .
<p>
The 7th and the 15th adhikAram of Swamy  Desikan's Srimath
Rahasya Thraya Saaram ( Mumukushthav and Utthara Krithya
adhikAram) are very relevant to read in this context .
<p>
There are very many things to discuss about dreams . Bhagavath chinthanai and AchArya Bhakthi are the best
medicine for destroying bad dreams ( Dhussvapna naasakam)  .
