<H3><a name="The_significance_of_Saraswati_in_Sri_Vaishnava_Sampradhaaya"></a>1. The significance of Saraswati in Sri Vaishnava Sampradhaaya </H3>

<p>
In the post-Vedic mythology, Saraswati is recognized as the goddess of Speech
and the wife of Brahma, the son of Vishnu. 
<p>
In Vedas, Saraswati is part of a triad. The other two are: Bharathi and Ila.
Bharathi is recognized as the wife of one of the Adityas and Ila is recognized
as the wife of Vishnu or Maha Lakshmi. In Kanchipuram, Sthalapuranas refer in
this context to Brahma"s Yajna to gain the blessings of Sriman Narayana to take
the Archa form of Varaadraja. 
<p>
<H3><a name="Goddess_sarasvathi_as_a_vedic_triumvirate_for_vedic_speech"></a>2. Goddess sarasvathi as a vedic triumvirate for vedic speech</H3>

<p>
In Vedic parlance , division of doctrines , divinities into 
a three fold classification is very popular . ChanandhOgya
Upanishad refers to this three-fold partition for those
with names and forms :taasAm thrivritham thrivritham 
ekaikam karavANIthi ( Ch.U: VI.3.2-3) . This means :
This aforesaid Brahman entering these deities as the individual
Self , which is THE SELF, evolved the differentiation of 
the (various ) names and forms( naama roopa VyAkaravANithi).
<p>
These three fold differentiation for Vedic Speech according
to the Vedam is :
<p>
IDA , Sarsvathi and Bhaarathi . Here IDA is praiseworthy 
speech ; Sarasvathi is the speech full of Knowledge ;
Bhaarathi is the speech full of Vedic lore as understood 
from the following manthram of Yajur Vedam :
<p>
tisrO dEvIrbahirdhagum sadhanthviDA Sarasvathi Bhaarathi
MahI gruNAnA -- Yajur Vedam : Canto 28.19
<p>
( Meaning ) : May IDA orILA , Sarasvathi and Bhaarathi 
or MahI , three mighty forms of speech (eulogies ) 
fill this sathas ( Yaaga sAlA ).
<p>
AitrEya BrAhmANam points out distinctly that Sarasvathi
is the Divine Speech ( Ait.Br. II.24; III.1,2) . She
is the Goddess of the Word in a symbolic sense . 
<p>
The word Sarasvathi also refers to the Supreme Brahman as well .
The commentators have agreed with this intrepretation 
of the Lord's name as Sarasvathi on the basis of conviction
that there can not be any one associated with Brahma VidyA 
or supreme knowledge that redeems us .It has been pointed out
that " Our Lord has manifested Himself in His creation and 
in His word ( Vedams ) as Knowledge Personified " ( Saras: 
prasmasithA jn~AnaadhaayO guNA vidhyanthE yasyaam saa 
SARVA VIDHYAA PRAAPIKAA VAAK ). 
<p>
<H3><a name="Derivation_of_the_Word_Sarasvathi"></a>3. Derivation of the Word Sarasvathi </H3>

<p>
The word takes its birth from the root " Sr" ,
(gathou) meaning to move or to flow. When the 
particle mathup is added , we get the word "Sarasvathi" .
Saras also means knowledge of transcendental kind 
and the One in whom such knowledge is sustained 
is Sarasvathi .The connection to Supreme Brahman 
and Sarasvathi is hinted at Rg. Vedic Manthram :
<p>
SarasvathIm dEvayanthO havanthE 
SarasvathIm adhvarE thAyamAnE I
SarasvathIm sukruthO ahvayantha 
SarasvathI dhAsushE vaarya dhAth II
<p>
(Meaning ) :" Men aspiring for transcendental knowledge 
invoke the Lord Sarasvathi ; when one aspires to 
undertake sacred works for the good of all (adhvaraa),
they also invoke SarasvathI . This Sarasvathi blesses all
of them who dedicate themselves for the noble ends. "

<p>
ILA SarasvathI MahI tisrO dEvIrmaYObhuva:
barhi:m seedhanthvasthridha: --Rg Vedam : I.13.9
<p>
(Meaning ) : May the three undecaying Goddesses , 
givers of the delight of enlightened speech ,
ILA , SarasvathI and Mahi , sit down upon
the sacred grass ( ThUppul ) of this Yaj~nam .
<p>
<H3><a name="The_many_names_of_sarasvathi"></a>5. The many names of sarasvathi </H3>

<p>
Bharathi --Eloquence
MahA VidyA -Transcendent Knowledge
Maha VaaNi- Transcendent Word
AaryA--The Noble and revered One
Braahmi-- The power behind the immense One 
Kaama DhEnu- The wish granting Cow 
Bija Garbhaa-- Womb of the elements of divine speech 
<p>
KarapAtri's Sri Bhagavathi Tattvam and Harsha 
CharithA give a beautiful decription of 
Sarasvathi Devi as a beautiful Goddess clad 
in white and sitting on a white lotus with
a VeeNA , Pusthakam , Japa MaalA and ankusam 
and occasionally with a conch and a bow et al 
( VishNU Chinnams in general and that Of 
Sri HayagrIvA in particular) . 
<p>
<H3><a name="Her_AarAdhanam"></a>6. Her AarAdhanam </H3>

<p>
On the Sarasvathi PoojA day , books , Sri Sookthis
and musical instruments are dusted , placed on an
altar and She is invoked and saluted as the embodiment
of Vedic speech and Divine Knowledge by many . 
<p>
The paramikAnthins follow the direction of Swami 
Desikan and recognize Her as having the power of
Divine Speech due to the anugraham of Sri HayagrIva
BhagavAn . They perform a special AarAdhanam for
BhagavAn HayagrIvA ( VaajI vakthrA VaasydEvasya 
Moorthy: )that day .Their reasoning is that Sarasvathi ,
DakshINA Moorthy and Sages VyaasA , ParAsarA and 
VaalmIki shine as great ones due to a small speck 
of the power of Sri HayagrIvan .
<p>
<p>
Saraswathi"s anger at her husband and the effort to destroy her husband's Yajna
as a Fast flowing river (Vega Vaahini) and the Lord's hampering of that effort
through his role as a dam to arrest the flow of Saraswati and the intended
consequences. In one of the Divya Desams of Kanchi associated with this legend,
Saraswati, the daughter-in-law is standing at the feet of the reclining Lord
seeking His pardon for the Aparaadham.  
<p>
In the post-Vedic Purana period, Sarawati is also recognized as one of the
Sapta Sindhus (Vitasta, Indus, Asikni, Parushni, Vipaasha, Sutudri and
SARASWATI.) 
<p>
In the Vedic parlance, Saraswati is not a river , but Vedic Speech couched in
Seven meters(Gayatri, Trishtup, Jagati, Brihati, Anushyup, Ushnik and Pankti).
Seven Sister rivers or Vedic Speech is also understood as the organs , which
"convey " knowledge: Two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and tongue. 
<p>
The Mythology is a post-Vedic Development. The Vedas and Brahmanaas recognize
Saraswati as the DIVINE SPEECH (Aitreya Brahmaanam II.24, III .1,2 ) .The Rig
Vedam in Particular recognizes Saraswati at many places as the Divine Speech
associated weith revealed Knowledge( RV X.17.7, I.13.9, X.110.8,I.22.10,.I.3,
11-12) . 
<p>
Yajur Vedic Verse(XXVII. 19) praises the divine speech and recognizes its
three different aspects as Ida(Priaseworthy Speech), Saraswati (a speech
full of divine Knowledge) and Bharathi (a speech replete with Vedic Lore).
<p>
Another Yajur vedic verse( VIII.43 )describes the eleven qualities of noble and
divine Saraswati as a woman and pays Tribute to Her::Praisewrthy (Ideh),
Delightful (Ranteh), Worshipful (Havyeh), Lovable( Kaamyeh), Plesuregiving
(Chandreh), Well known for virtuous qualities and inviolable (Jyothiradhiteh),
Full of divine knowledge (SARASWATI) ,Mahi (adorable), Visruthi (Knower of the
Vedas and worthy of respect) . This mantra seeks the blessings of the Lady of
11 noble qualities .
<p>
Yet another verse of Yajur Veda(XXIX.8) Prays : " May Bharati ,the speech of
Adityas, illuminate your Yajna; May Saraswati, the speech of Rudras ,be our
helper.  May Ida, the speech invoked in accord by the Vasus give us happiness.
May these three Goddesses place us amongst the immortals ".  The reference to
Adityas, Rudras and Vasus are to three types of Celibiates.  These three
intellectual forces are beseeched to guide us and be the source of our Comfort
elsewhere in Yajur Veda . 
<p>
Atharva Veda also recognizes Saraswati as the manifold streams of knowledge and
blessings of this and the other world. 
<p>
Devaraja Yajvan, the commentator of Yaska"s Niruktam derives the word Saraswati
as "Sarah Prasaranamasyaastithiti ". ,i.e. Sarawati is the one , whose expanse
is this creation. This concept is backed by the Rg Vedic Verse(X.17.7) quoted
above:
<p>
" Men aspiring for transcendental knowledge invoke the LORD Saraswati; When one
aspires to undertake sacred works for the good of all (Adhvara), they also
invoke Saraswati. This Saraswati blesses all of them , who dedicate themselves
for noble ends." This fits with the Intrepretation of Aurobindo who equates
Saraswati to the Vedic Rtam , the truth -consciousness principle.. 
<p>
The link between man's limited mind and vast Cosmic mind/ intelligence/speech
(Saraswati= Rtam Brihat) is implied in the invocation of the Vedic Naama of
Saraswati according to these scholars.
<p>
The short statement of the Link between Saraswati and Sri Vaishnavism in my
humble opinon is that of the Niruktam definition, which identifies Saraswati as
the entire expanse of creation as the body of the Lord Sriman Narayana.
<p>
Here are two salutations to Saraswati from the Rg Veda:
<p>
"Saraswati ,the inspirer of those who delight in truth, the instructress of the
right- minded ,has accepted our sacrifice(SandhyaVandhanam?)." Rg Vedam I.3.11
<p>
"Saraswati makes manifest by Her acts a mighty river and in Her own form
enlightens ALL understandings." Rg Vedam I.3.12
<p>
Sarasvathi
manthram is one of the Pancha PraNavams ( AIM pronounced
as AYM ) . Saarsavatha PrayOgam is eloquent speech blessed
by Sarasvathi Devi .Sarasvathi also means flowing
water ( Knowledge) .The DhAthu "Rayi" forming the word
Sarasvathi means , "Water" or "Wealth" . 
<p>
<p>
<H3><a name="Post_Vedic_period"></a>7. Post-Vedic period</H3>

Sarasvathi Devi is the consort of BrahmA 
at the post-vEdic , PurANic level . The Lord of Creation 
and son of PadmanAbhA is wedded to Knowledge
(Sarasvathi ) .Many of the stories referred to
in BrahmaNAs and PurANAs regarding the creation 
and the origin of mankind center around the figure 
of Chathurmukhan , the HiraNya Garbham ( the golden
embryo ) Brahmaa and His consort (Sarasvathi) , 
their progeney PrajApathis , Maanasa puthrAs 
like NaaradhA , Sanath KumArA et al , SvAayambhuva 
Manu ( one of the great law givers) , MatsyAvathAram ,
et al .If BrahmA is the source of Knowledge (VedAs) 
as a result of Sri HayagrIva BhagavAn's blessings 
and initiation , then Sarasvahti is considered 
as manifestation of that Knowledge itself .She
represents the union of power and intelligence
from which organized creation arises .
<p>
She is worshipped as BrahmaNi in SandhYavandhanam .
She is involed here as SandhyAdhi Devathai .
In each of the SandhyAs , Sarasvathi is invoked 
at different directions to receive our salutations:
<p>
Morning: Sarasvathyai Nama: ( North )
Noon: Sarsavathyai nama: ( West )
Evening: Sarasvathyai Nama: ( South )
The prefix of PraNavam goes before the vandhanams.
<p>
Vardha Tantram (574) explains the significance of Her
manthram: Aimm( Iymm ) .This bhIjAksharam "AI"
represents Sarasvathi . The nasalization (imm) means
the removing of pain from avidhyA . The purpose of
doing the Japam of this Pancha PraNavam is for 
the acquiring of knowledge and wisdom , mastery 
over words and the power of speech . 
<p>
There will be no RaamAyaNam without Sarasvathi .
BrahmA says in Baala KhAndham to Sage VaalmIki :
<p>
slOka yEvAsthvayam baddhO naathra kaarya vichAraNA
macchandhAdhEva tE Brahman PRAVRUTTHEYAM SARASVATHI
( Srimadh RaamAyaNam : Bala KhANDam-canto2 .31)
<p>
(Meaning): Let the metrical commposition be conducive
to your glory alone.You need not brood over this 
anymore. Through My will alone , has this speech
( sarasvathi) flowed from your lips .
<p>
Here the reference is to the SlOkam , Maa nishAdha--",
which spontaneously flowed from Sage Valmiki's lips,
when he saw the painful death of one of the Krouncha 
Pakshi dampathis by a unfeeling hunter near his tapOvanam .
<p>
There will be no YathOkthakAri PerumAL ,
VeghA Sethu SthOthram or Kanchi VaradarAjan 
incarnating as the palan of BrahMA's Yajnam 
withourt Sarasvathi . 
<p>
She is the personification of the Vegavathi river , 
who flowed in fury over Her husband's insult and 
the Lord incarnated as the Sethu ( aNai or Dam ) to stop
His daughter intent on destroying the Yajnam 
at Hasthigiri done by His son .First came 
ThiruvehhA EmperumAn ( YathOkthakaari) and 
next came Kaanchi VaradarAjan . Swami Sri Desikan 
salutes this Lord in VegA sethu sthuthi :
<p>
yEkam Vegavathi madhyE Hasthi sailE cha dhrusyathE
upAya pala bhAvEna svayam vyakatham param na: ( Slokam 1) 
<p>
Next Swami says , here stopped the flow of Sarasvathi:
<p>
" yathra Saarasvatham srOthO visrAmayathi visrungalam ".
<p>
That is why at this divya desam , Sarasvathi stands 
with anjali at the foot of the reclining Lord offering
Kaimkaryam to Her father in law to overcome the apachAram .
<p>
Without additional quotations from the sources ,
let me say that Sarasvathi Pooja is an important
tradition . Lord HayagrIvan's small portion of sakthi
( sakthi lEsam ) provides the power for Vaak dEvi ,
DakshiNA mUrthy and Sage VyAsA :
