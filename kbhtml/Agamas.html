The Agama has three main divisions - Saiva (based on Siva as the Deity), Sakta (based on worship of Sakti as the Deity) , and vaishNava.
<p>
There are further sub-divisions among each of the Agama-s. The principal divisions in the vaishNava Agama are the <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Vaikhanasa.html" class=wikipagelink>vaikhAnasa</a> and <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Pancaratra.html" class=wikipagelink>pAncarAtra</a>.
<p>
In the historical evolution of the Agama-s, there have been several views over time - 
<UL >
<li>a) Agama-s are derived from the <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Vedas.html" class=wikipagelink>vedas</a>, 
<li>b) Agama and veda are both derived from a common root or mUla-veda, 
<li>c) Agama-s are inferior to, and less authoritative than the veda, and 
<li>d) Agama-s are superior to veda. 
</UL>
It was probably these kinds of differences that led to Sri YamunacArya's work titled Agama-prAmANya and Sri <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/vdesikan">VedAnta desika's</a> work titled SrI pAncarAtra rakshA. It should be noted that SrI vedAnta deSika has also written a work about the vaikhAnasa Agama titled sajjanavaibhava. 
<p>
The development of the Agama schools gave great support to promoting the concept of bhakti by concentrating attention on one Deity, and to self-surrender. It also gave great support to art through temple architecture, devotional poetry, dance, etc.
