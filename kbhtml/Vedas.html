<H3><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</H3>

Veda manthrAs are very important.  They are the root of the tree of
DharmA .  These manthrAs have been classified under three heads : Rg , Yajus
and Saama. 
<p>
Atharva VedA has its own place for the approach of the Brahman thru
tantrA and other rituals . Rg vedam thru prayer and intellectual pursuits;
Yajur Vedam thru invocation of Agni for transporting the message enshrined in
hymns to the Sureme . Saama Vedam thru rendering of those hyms of Rg and Yajur
vedams in music or singing . 
<p>
<H3><a name="Jaimini_s_definition"></a>2. Jaimini's definition</H3>

thEshAm Rg YathrArthavasEna pAdhavyasthA (JS :1.12.35)
<p>
(Meaning ) : The name Rg (rik ) is applied to those manthrAs that are divided
into paadhAs ( feet ) , that is , certain well defined parts , each of which
consists of a definite number of syllables ; and are called on that account by
such prosodial names (chandas) like GayathrI(24 syllables), Trishtup (44) ,
Bruhathi (36) ,Anushtup (32) Asthi (64) , Jagathi (48 ) et al . 
<p>
Saama Vedam is defined as the one given to music , where the mantrAs are sung
in different styles of music like RathantarA , Brihath and the like .  These
different methods of singing are followed precisely . Bruhath sAman is sung for
instance with force and loudly in contrast to RathAnthara saaman ( geethishu
SamAkhyA : JS 1.12.36).
<p>
Yajur Veda mantrAs are defined as those
not having metres (paadhams ) or associated
with singing ( sEshu yaju: sabdha: ). If there 
are any metrical portion in Yajur vedam , 
they are considered by some under the above 
strict definition as comparitively modern . 
<p>
The two kinds of hymns are further dividable across 
the four vEdAs as SthOthrAs and SaasthrAs :
<p>
sthuthasasrayOasthu samskArE 
yAjyaAvadhyEvatA abhidhAnathvAth - Js: 1.5.13
<p>
SthOthrAs and SaasthrA hymns bring about santification like
YaajyA hymns , because they distinctly signify deities 
( which are sEshAs to the SEshi ) .
<p>
SthOthrAs are the name of those hymns that
consist of manthrAs capable of being set to
music and sung ,- as distinct form the SaasthrA
hymns consisting of manthrAs not sung .
<p>
<p>
<H3><a name="The_two_kinds_of_Knowledge_Para_and_apara_vidhyAs"></a>3. The two kinds of Knowledge: Para and apara vidhyAs</H3>

<p>
The great tradition of the transmisison of knowledge 
thru AchArya Mukham is recorded in Mundaka Upanishad 
as a conversation between BrahmA , the creator and his 
eldest son, AtharvA about the knowledge of BRAHMAN ,
the corner stone of ALL knowledge .AtharvA taught 
what he had learned from his father to AngirA , 
who in turn taught it to SatyavAhA belonging to 
the clan of BharadvAjA ;SatyavAhA passed that 
supreme knowledge in succession to Sage Angiras . 
<p>
SaunakA , the celebrated grahasthA approached Sage 
Angiras and asked humbly : " O Illustrious sage !
kasminnu BhagavO vig~nyAthE sarvamidham vig~nAtham
bhavathee ? ( What is that by the knowing of which
all this becomes known ? ) . 
<p>
Sage Angiras replied : " two kinds of knoweldge 
needs to be known according to the knowers of Brahman .
They are the higher knowledge ( parA ) and the lower
knowledge (aparA )" . 
<p>
Sage Angiras explained further that the lower knowledge
is the Rig Veda, the Yajur VedA , the Saama VedA and
Atharva VedA , SikshA (phonetics ) , kalpA ( rituals ) ,
vyAkarNam ( grammer) , NirukthA (etymology ) ,cchandas
(metre) and JyOthisham ( astronomy ) ; and the higher 
knowledge is that by which the imperishable Brahman 
is attained .
<p>
Sage Angiras said :" dhvE vidhyE vEdhithavyE ithi 
ha sma yadh BrahmavidhO vadanthi ParA chaivAparA cha "
AparA are the four VedAs and their six angAs to understand 
the nature of DharmA and the ParA is the knowledge 
about the imperishable ( akshaya ) Brahman , which 
is the embodiment of DharmA . That omniscient ,
Omnipotent , all merciful Brahman has been defined 
as the source/origin , sustenance and dissolution of this 
multifacetted world according to the second Brahma sUthrA
( JanmAdhyasya yatha: ) .That Brahman is cognized only 
through the scriptures , the sources of authoritative 
knowledge about Brahman ( Saasthra yOnithvAth: Brahma-
sUthram 1.3 ).The next Brahma sUtram goes on to point
out that Brahman is the main purport of all Vedic 
and upanishadic texts ( tatthu samanvayAth ) . Thus 
one can not dismiss the VedAs quickly as 
apara vidhyA and jump on to Para vidhyA . 
Rigorous study of the VedAs reveal 
to us the appproach to Brahman , the para VidhyA , 
the ultimate goal for us all .
<p>
<H3><a name="The_four_categories_of_Knowledge_in_the_VedAs"></a>4. The four categories of Knowledge in the VedAs</H3>

<p>
The four VedAs contain four important categories 
of knowledge related to DharmA : (1) Injunctions
and Prohibitions (2) Valedictory ( praise ) and 
depreceatory passages (3) MantrAs and (4) Names .
All these four are necessary to understand true
DharmA or righteous duty from different angles.
Thus an inquiry in to them through the study 
of the VedAs becomes an essential pre-requisite 
in one's journey towards the comprehension of 
Brahman ( para VidhyA ) . The authority of
the VedAs for us is supreme and final and hence 
a proper understanding of them with 
the help of a qualified AchAryA sets us on 
a safe footing to comprehend Brahman 
and achieve the parama purushArtham of 
Moksham .Our tradition is therefore 
called Vaidhikam or the one based on 
the authoritativeness of the VedAs . 
<p>
<H3><a name="The_four_kinds_of_Veda_SamhithAs"></a>5. The four kinds of Veda SamhithAs</H3>

<p>
There are four Veda Samhitas
(Rg, Yajur, Sama and Atharva). The Yajur Vedam has two Samhitas known as the
Krishna and Sukla Yajur Vedas . Hence , One can say that there are 5 Veda
Samhitas, if we take into account the 2 Samhitas of Yajur Veda. Each of the 4
Samhitas referred to above has several branches or Saakaas. Each Saaka has a
Karma Khanda dealing with the actions to be performed and is made up of Mantras
and Btrahmanaas. Latter deals with Upasana or meditation and has Aranyakas
inside them for the benefit of those who have resorted to the quiet habitat of
the forest to pursue their spiritual Quest.  The <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Upanishads.html" class=wikipagelink>Upanishads</a> are found mostly in
the Aranyaka section of the Vedas .
<p>
The oldest
VedA is recognized as Rig Vedam and the youngest
is the Atharva Vedam . 
<p>
<H4><a name="Samhita"></a>5.1. Samhita</H4>

The word Samhita is a Vedic word meaning a congregation 
of several independent units. Like all other Vedic 
words , it has several meanings as well .
<p>
In the Vedic context , Yajur Veda Samhita means redactions 
of the Rg Verses according to different schools or sakaas
or branches such as Vajasaneyi -Madhyandhina Sukla Yajur
Veda or the white Yajur Veda. There is another samhita known as
Taittiriya Samhita or the Krishna Yajur Veda , which is more akin
to a BrahmaNaa rather than Sruthi .There are many rescensions of 
both sukla and krishna yajur veda samhithAs . 
<p>
When we use the larger definition , a congregation of 
several independent units , then AagamAs like PaancharAtra 
with its independent samhithAs dealing with temple ritual 
onwards ,Brahma SamhitA ( hymns of Brahma in praise of Lord KrishNA 
containing manthrAs such as Kama bija manthram and 
kaama gayatri manthram and a host of other topics 
ranging from GanesA , DurgA to BhagavAn KrishNa ) , 
Bhrigu SamhitA dealing with Jyothisha saasthram , 
DakshiNA murthy Samhitha ( Taantric work dealing with 
Sri Vidya UpAsanA ) , Susrutha samhitha dealing with 
Aayur Vedam , ALL of these fall in place.
<p>
SamhitA also is made up two words ( sam +hitha ).
It means roughly one that brings hitham close to one .
There are lot of aspects to the word SamhitA , which 
are worthy of intrepretation . 
<p>
<H4><a name="Brahmanas"></a>5.2. Brahmanas</H4>

BrahmaaNAs is that portion of the Vedas , which
states rules for the employment of the hymns at 
the various YaagAs and Yaj~nAs , their origin 
and dtailed explanation, with some times lengthy 
illustrations in the form of legends and stories .
IT IS DISTINCT FROM THE MANTHRA PORTION OF THE VEDAS .
For instance , the conductance of AsvamEtha Yaagam
is in one of the BraahmaNAs .
<p>
BrahmaNAs are also " Sruthis " .
<p>
Each Veda has its own BraahmaNA(s).
Rg Vedam : IytharEya, AasvalAyana , Kouseethaki 
Yajur Vedam : sathapatha BraahmaNam
Saama Vedam : Pancha vimsa and Shad Vimsa 
Atharva Vedam : Gopatha BrAhmaNam 
<p>
<p>
<p>
<H3><a name="Atharva_Samhita"></a>6. Atharva Samhita</H3>

Atharva Samhita has nine branches 
or rescensions ( navadhAatharvaNO veda: ).These 
nine branches are : (1) PaippalAda (2) Tauda 
(3) MuNda (4) SaunakIya (5) Jaajala (6) Jalada
(7) BrAhmaveda (8) Devadarsa and (9) ChAraNavaidya .
Today , only two of the nine branches of Atharva 
Vedam (Saunakha and PaippalAda )are available to us.
The Delhi Vedic trsut has recorded the Saunakha sAkA .
<p>
The Atharva Veda samhithA has 5977 verses spread 
over 20 KhAndams ( books/chapters ) . The khAndams are
further subdivided into hymns and they in turn 
house a group of manthrAs .Some prefer to catalog the Atharva 
Veda Text (SamhithA )into prapaathakAs ( Lessons or
lectures ). Under this classification , there are 34
prapAthakAs that house the 5977 verses. Among NammAzhwAr's
four Tamil Prabhandhams , Periya ThiruvanthAdhi 
is considered as the essence of Atharva Vedam . 
<p>
<H4><a name="The_sacredness_of_atharva_vedam"></a>6.1. The sacredness of atharva vedam</H4>

<p>
This Vedam is closely tied with sages AtharvaNA and AngirA . 
The literal translation of the name of the above two sages 
( Rishis ) have been given as :
<p>
Atharvan= holy magic bringing happiness
Angiras = hostile or black magic 
<p>
The manthrams however contain more " theosophic 
matter" than any other samhithA and it is unfortunate
that the Atharva Vedam was not considered as an equal
to the other three by the Vedic priests for a long time. 
The Gopatha BrAhmaNam and the Mundaka Upanishad are 
associated with Atharva Vedam and house some of 
the profound thoughts linked to Atharva Vedam . 
<p>
<H4><a name="Ucchishta_brahmam_as_the_cosmic_creator"></a>6.2. Ucchishta brahmam as the cosmic creator</H4>

<p>
The concept of Ucchishta Bhrammam ( Final Reality ,
Sarva Seshi , Akshara Bhramam , the Undecaying Self )
is housed in this Vedam . In adition to housing 
Purusha sUktham like the other three VedAs ,
Atharva Vedam salutes with great reverence the Cosmic 
form of the Creator in a glorious hymn known as " Skhamba
sUktham "( AV X.7.1-44 ) .The heights of imagination ,
the sacredness of the conceptions are matchless .
<p>
Our Lord Sriman NaarAyaNA is visualized in this Vedam 
as the Master Weaver , who weaves the entire Universe with 
His divine thread (tanthu ) of Unified Law 
(rOhithO dhyAvA pruthvee jajAna tathra tanthum 
ParamEshtee tathAna ) .
<p>
Sriman NaarAyaNA , our Lord is conceived as 
the divine support ( Skhambha) that sustains 
the Universe --the terrestrial ,the interspace 
and the celestial regions --in the most perfect manner . 
Great concepts of Mathematics are invoked 
to describe the way in which our Lord balances 
the entire creation and holds the six dimensions of space
in a marvellous equalibrium ( skhambhO dhAdhAra pravisa:
shaDurvee skhambha idham bhuvanamA vivEsa ) . His leela
of Creation at the auspicious stage ( Sri Rangam )
has been compared to the weaving of a Cosmic Cloth 
" with divine woofs and warps , shuttles and pegs , 
the art of two divine maidens (day and night )
working incessantly in the parameters of Space and Time .
<p>
<p>
<H3><a name="Rg_Veda_SamhithA"></a>7. Rg Veda SamhithA</H3>

<p>
This ancient Vedam has 1,028 sUkthams (hymns ) 
and contains in all 10,589 verses.These are grouped 
into either 8 KhAndAs or 10 MandalAs with 85 anuvAkAs
( subsections ) . There used to be 21 sakAs ( redactions )
of the Rig VedAs . There is only one available today .
That is Saakala SaakA . IythrEya Upanishad belongs to
Rig Veda SamhithA .NammAzhwAr's Thiruviruttham 
is consdieres as the Veda SaarArtham of Rig Vedam .
<p>
<H3><a name="Yajur_Veda_SamhithA"></a>8. Yajur Veda SamhithA</H3>

<p>
This Vedam has 1975 verses grouped under 40 
chapters known as adhyAyAs .The longest chapter has 
117 "verses" and the shortest chapter has 13 "verses ".
There are two Yajur samhithAs : Sukla and KrishNa
( White and Black ) samhithAs . The White Yajur Veda
samhithA is also known as VajasanEyi -MadhyAndina Sukla 
Yajur vedam to distinguish it from KrishNa Yajur
Veda or Taittiriya SamhithA , which is generally
considered to be more close to a BrahmaNA rather than to
a Sruthi . Most of the people in AndhrA and Tamil Naadu
are KrishNa Yajur Vedins . 
<p>
The two samhithAs have number of recensions inview of
their wide popularity .These variations arose from 
a variety of textual differences and their applications
in Vedic rituals . The two popular recensions of
the Sukla Yajur Vedam are : MaadhyAndhina and 
KaaNva ; the KrishNa Yajur Vedam has three recensions :
kAtaka , Kapishtala-Kata and MaithrAyaNee .
<p>
<H3><a name="Saama_samhithA"></a>9. Saama samhithA</H3>

<p>
In its importance in YaagAs and sacredness ,
Saama Veda SamhithAs rank next to Rig VedA .
The Lord of GeethA however has put this 
Saama samhithA on the top of all four 
SamhithAs with His declaration that He is
Saama VedA among the VedAs .This samhithA 
consists of hyms chanted by udhgAtri priests 
at the Soma YaagAs . Many of the hymns originate 
from Rig Vedam and have been rearranged without
reference to the original order in the Rig Vedam 
and set to music .Only 75 verses of the total of 
1,875 verses of Saama Vedam are not to be found 
in Rig Vedam . The remaining 1,800 verses are 
essentially the repetitions of Rig Vedic verses .
The important distinction however is that they are 
sung instead of being recited.The Rig Vedam
deals with knowledge and Saama Vedam deals 
with UpAsanA , Worship and DhyAnam .
<p>
According to one classification , the Saama
samhithA is cataloged under two sections :
PurvArchikA and UttarArchikA . Each archikA 
is subdivided into prapaathakAs and adhyAyAs .
In another classification , the 1875 verses 
are grouped under FOUR categories :
<p>
1. PurvArchikA: 585 verses (1-585 )
2. AraNya KhAndam : 55 verses ( 586-640 )
3. MahAnAmnyArchikA : 10 verses( 641-650 )
4. UttarArchikA: 1225 verses ( 651-1875) 
<p>
In singing , the priests of the Yaj~nams 
follow specific styles through alteration of 
prolongation , repetition , modulation , 
rests et al . These become the various 
styles of Saama GhAnams : congregational
( GrAma gEya GhAnam ) , AraNya ghAnam
( Forest song style ) , Uha ghAnam and
Uhya GhAnam .
<p>
Saama Vedam had originally 1001 branches . 
We have very few left now. NammAzhwAr's celebrated 
Thiruvaimozhi is recognized as the Saama Veda 
SaarArtham .
<p>
<H3><a name="The_Connection_Between_Purva_and_Uttara_mImAmsam"></a>10. The Connection Between Purva and Uttara mImAmsam</H3>

<p>
Purva MeemAsam deals with the karma khAndam 
sections/rituals of the VedAs . In an earlier article , 
I referred to PurvamImAmsam 's first sUtram : 
athAthO dharma jigy~nAsA ( Now , therefore , 
there must be an inquiry into the nature of duty );
In that context , I quoted the first sUthram of 
BadarAyaNA , athAthO Brahma jigy~nAsA ( Now , therefore ,
let us proceed with the inquiry of the infinite and eternal
Brahman ) . I mentioned that the study and performance 
of the Vedic sacrifices have ephemeral and limited 
fruits , whereas the results of the knowledge of
Brahman is eternal and infinite and therefore 
the inquiry into the nature of Brahman should be
undertaken with the appropriate AchAryAs .It is however
not possible to skip the study of VedAs and 
jump on to the inquiry about Brahman .
