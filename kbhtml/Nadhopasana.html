Nadhopaasana/Nama Sakirtana has helped many Prapannas as an effective Upasana
Marga to reach the Lord. 
<p>
<H3><a name="Saint_Thyagaraja"></a>2. Saint Thyagaraja</H3>

The foremost among the Prapannas , who used
Nadhopaasana is Saint Thyagaraja, whose compositions house his Cahranagati to
Sri Rama in the classical manner of Prapatti done by a Sri Vaishnava. The
relationship between sama Veda , Nadhopaasana and Prapatti has been referred to
by Saint Thygaraja in many of his Kritis. Nadhopasana as a way of surrendering oneself at the feet of Sriman Narayana as
revealed from the life of Saint Thyagaraja, one of the most prominent among Sri
Vaishanavas , who followed the Prapatti margam is covered below.
<p>
<H3><a name="Sama_Vedam_and_Nadhopasana"></a>3. Sama Vedam and Nadhopasana</H3>

<p>
The Sama Veda has special links to Pranavam and Nadhopasana. The Sama Veda
Mantras are sung by Udgatri Preists at Vedic rituals. Their singing is known as
Udgita. The Pranavam is also referred to as the imperishable Udgita by
Chandogya Upanishad, a major Upanishad belonging to the Sama Veda. The
following Chandogya Upanishad passage points out the importance of Pranavam
(Udgita) for the Upasana of Brahman thru Nada: " This Om , this imperishable
Udgita must be worshipped. Of all the objects of creation, the Earth is the
essence; Of Earth, the essence is water; Of Water , the essence is Hebs; Man is
the essence of the Herbs; Poetry is the essence of Speech; Music is the essence
of Poetry; The Udgita of Sama Veda embodied by the Pranava is the essence of
Music; Thus, this Omkaara (Pranava Nada) is the utmost, the most valuble , the
final essence of all essences. It must be worshipped." This Upanishadic passage
asserts that the Nada and Music are intimately connected to the Udgita of
samans , which is the same as that of Pranavam. In this context, the Upasana
practised by the Nada Yogis is considered equivalent to the meditation on
Pranavam done by the other type of Yogis to attain God Realization.
<p>
The Links between Nadhopasana and Udgita of Samans is hinted by Lord Krishna ,
when he says that He is the Sama Veda among all the Vedas. He points out the
efficacy of attaining Him thru Nadhopasana with its roots in Pranavam
(Udgitam).The importance of Pranava Udgitam is once again revealed from the
portion of the holy Hayagreeva Mantram(Om Pranavodgita Vachase Nama:) Lord
Hayagreeva is the Lord of all Vidyas including Brahma Vidya. The portion of His
Mantram recognizes that His speech is the form of Pranava Udgitam.
<p>
The Upasana of Brahman thru Sama Gana (Udgita Upasana) has been pointed out by
Sage Yagnyavalkya , the greatest authority on Smrithis this way: "Clearing
one"s senses, memory, mind and intellect of all other objects, the supreme
Atman , which is within oneself shining like a lamp should be contemplated
upon. Intoning Sama Gana in the proper manner without break and practising it
with Concentration makes one attain the supreme Godhead."
<p>
<H3><a name="Vina_music_and_Sama_Gana"></a>4. Vina music and Sama Gana</H3>

<p>
Sage Yagnyavalkya has also revealed that the singing of the Samans to the
accompaniment of Vina makes one obtain the boon of Moksha. He says: " He , who
knows the truth of Vina Music and who is an expert in Srutis(musical) and Talas
reaches the path of salvation effortlessly" He calls them Sruthi Jati
Visaaradaas. It is appropriate to note that the Vinadara Dakshina Murthy plays
SAma Gana on His Vina to indicate the efficacy of that Upasana to attain the
highest knowledge. Saint Thyagaraja, one of the greatest Nadhopasaka as well as
a Vainika paid tribute to Vinadara Dakshinamurthy in his Saramati Raga Kriti
"Mokshamu Galada".Thygaraja also salutes Narada as his Guru Raya for knowing
the truth of Music originating from the Veda-Born Vina. The importance of
Nadhopasana and Sama Gana is inferred from ther tradition of Vina playing in
major Vedic sacrifices such as Aswameda Yaga. The Vina Mirasu of Talapakkam
Annamacharya and that of Arayars before the Lord Of Srirangam and elsewhere
attest to the same principle.
<p>
<H3><a name="Omkara_the_Seven_Svaras_and_Nada"></a>5. Omkara, the Seven Svaras and Nada</H3>

<p>
In his Saramati Raga Kriti, Thygaraja expatiates on the origin of Nada from Om.
He recognizes the birth of Nada from the interaction of Pranaa and Agni. He
points out further that the seven Svaras and Nada originated from the Omkara
described by the Udgita of the Upanishads. His describtion of Lord Krishna in
the Hindola RagA Kriti reveals brilliantly the intimate connection between Sama
Veda, Sapta Svaras and Pranavam: "Sama Nigamaja Sudhamaya Gana Vichakshana
Vedasiromatruja Saptasvara Nadaachala Deepa" Here he says: " O Lord Krishna
shining like a beacon of light on the mountain of Nada based on the seven
Svaras born of Pranavam, which is the source of all Vedanta! O Lord adept in
the nectar-like music born of Sama Veda! O celebrated Lord, who transcends
Time! Please protect me ."
<p>
In his Chenchu Kambhoji Kriti "Vara raga Layajnalu", He says that NADA BORN OF
SEVEN SVARAS EMANATING FROM THE BODY OF NADHOPASAKA IS OF THE FORM OF THE
SACRED PRANAVAM. IN HIS ANDHOLIKA RAGA kRITI,"RAGASUDHARASA", THE SAINT REVEALS
THAT THE GREAT SOULS , WHO HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF Svarasthanas , Nada,and Omkara
are really Jivan Muktas or liberated souls in this Life.In the concluding
portion of this Kriti, he says that Nada, Svara and Pranava are of the very
form of Sadasiva Himself. In his Chittaranjani song, "Nada Tanumanusam", the
saint states that Siva is verily Nada and particularly the quintessence of Sama
Veda, the best among the Vedas. Here he states that the Seven Svaras originated
from the 5 faces of Sadasiva.
<p>
The sacredness of Nadhopasana is pointed out by the saint in his
Kalyanavasantha raga Kriti, "Nadaloludai". Here he appeals to us to attain
Brahmannda(Eternal bliss) thru Nadhopasana, the path followed by the Trimurthys
and Sages. In his Garudadwani krit "Ananda Sagaramidhani", he converses with
Rama and states : "O Rama! The body that does not float on the ocean of the
ineffable bliss of Brahman called Sangita Jnana , which abides in all the
Vedas, is a burden to Earth.Have not the holy Trinity and other sacred persons
worshipped it? " In another Kriti, he has stated that the nectar of Ragas based
on the Sapta Svaras originating from Pranavam gives one the auspicious results
of Yaga, Yoga, Thyaga(sacrifice) and Bhoga(Enjoyment). He asks us to drink that
nectar and delight in it. In his Atana Kriti, "Sripapriya", the saint describes
Rama as the Lord of Lakshmi and as the one , who moves easily among the seven
Svaras. He asks us to worship the seven Svaras sanctified by Rama. In his
Jaganmohini raga Kriti, "Sobillillu Sapta Svara Sundarulu   Bhajimpave", he
states that the sapta Svaras shine thru the navel, heart,throat, tongue , nose
etc., and in and thru Rg, Sama Vedas and the heart of Gayatri Mantra and in the
minds of holy men and Gods..Such is the greatness of Pranavam or Udgita for
Nadhopasana to attain perfection in one"s efforts for the realization of
Brahman.Following this route, Saint Thygaraja offered Prapatti with all its 6
limbs to Lord Ramachandra and Sita Devi and attained the highest of Blisses.

The name of another Nadhopasaka /Nama sankirtana
practioner comes into my mind, i.e. Acharya Bodhendral, one of the
Sankaracharyas of the Kanchipuram line. He gave up his Post as the head pontiff
and retired to a village on the banks of Cauveri in Tanjore district &amp; preached
the efficacy of Rama Nama Siddhantha.His delectable verses contained in his
work known as Rama Karnaamruta are a source of great joy to recite. He made
Prapatti to Sri Rama. Adi sankara has made Prapatti to Lord Narasimha in times
of great distress as evidenced by his Lakshmi Nrsimha Karaavalampana Stotram.
Even today, The abode of the Sringeri Acharyas is known as Nrsimha Vanam. Adi
Sankara has devoted a lot of his energy to compose other stotras on Vishnu.
Infact, it is jocularly observed that Adi Sankara is " Anthar
Saakta:, Bahir Saiva: Vyavahareshu Vaishnava:" According to hagiography, his
travel in the sky over Guruvbayoor was arrested by Lord of that Temple to remind
Adi Sankara as to who is the strength behind his blessings.Adi Sankara is said
to have descended down to Earth and offered his worship to UnniKrishna and then
proceed on his way. I think the general regard that Saivas have for Vishanvism
is a direct result of Adi Sankara"s teachings emphasizing tolerance for the
common man thru his stotras and his own practises.
<p>
Another Prapanna/Nadhopasaka: Oothukkadu Venkatasubba Iyer. In an
earlier note, it was mentioned that he composed Kritis only on Krishna. It is
true that a majority of his Kritis are on Nartana Krishna enshrined at his
village . He also composed kritis on Rama (eg) Kalyana Rama in Raga
Hamsanadam.He has composed the Navavarana Kritis on Kamakshi . Bombay Sisters
have rendered these Kritis beautifully in a tape. He worshipped Krishna as Sri
Vidya Rajagopalan, a tradition practised in Mannargudi Temple, a famous temple
close to his village of OOthukkadu. There Sri Rajagopala icon is standing on Sri
Chakram , the Yantram of Worshippers of Sri Lalita Parameswari. Sri Chakram, the
geometric pattern of worship of Sri Vidya is also the Yantram of Sri Devi as one
can see from the coins distributed by the Ahobila Mutt. On one side of the Coin
, you will see the current Acharya and on the other side the traditional Sri
Chakram. There is agroup of Upasakas , who worship Krishna as Mohini or Madana
Gopala Sundari. Besides Oothukkadu Kavi , Leela Sukhar , the author of Krishna
Karaamrutam offered worship to Madana Gopala Sundari carrying the symbols of
Krishna(Flute, Shepard"s stick , Sudarsana, Conch ) and Of Sri lalita(Cane sugar
Bow, Ankusam, Flower arrows and noose). The mantram for this Murthy is made up
of the fusion of Panchadasakshari Mantra and Rajagopala Mantram. This is for
Tantric worshippers.
