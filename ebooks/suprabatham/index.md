<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
SrI Venkatesa SuprabhAtam composed by Sri PrathivAdhi Bhayankaram Anna is a SrI
Sookthi that is recited every morning in front of the Sayana Mantapam at Thirumalai.
This was composed by Sri ANNA at the request of his AchAryan, Sri MaNavALa
MaamunigaL. The divine inspiration for ANNaganrAryA came from ThoNDardippoDi
AzhwAr’s ThirupaLLiyezhucchi Paasurams and some of GodhA Piratti’s ThiruppAvai
Paasurams.
<p>
This is a simple word for word translation and was
put together to understand the actual cadence
and literal meaning of the verses so as to better 
appreciate the deep philosophical meanings they
represent and the commentaries written by others.
<p>
It draws heavily from the write ups of Oppiliappan Koil Varadachari Sadgopan

<b>Errors</b>
<p>
Condensing the rich and deep concepts into a simple word 
for word translation required making numerous compromises
which most certainly has led to errors, so please read 
with caution.
