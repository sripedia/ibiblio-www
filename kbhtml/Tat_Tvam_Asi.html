<H3><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</H3>

<p>
From  the  time immemorial, man's curiosity to find out the cause  of  the
universe  seems  to  be  of  undiminishing interest.  Various  parts  of the
world have come out with various schools of thoughts of philosophy and
practice.  Few  claim  that their  philosophy  is  "pure  philosophy"  staying
away  from any religion/theology while others  claim  that  their  philosophy
is "philosophy  of  a religion/theology". Beliefs and prejudices have had a
hand on many such outcomes. History attempts  to  trace  the political  and
social circumstances for these while science tries to rationalize them.  
<p>
The vEdhA  of  India  has  been  a strong base for numerous schools of
philosophical thoughts. The ancient tradition of India holds  that the  vEdhA
is  not  authored by any one and therefore is the only dependable ultimate
authority of knowledge. The vEdhA  is  further held as that which has no date
of origin or end and is supposed to be  infinite.  
<p>
The  analysis  of  a statement  in  the vEdhA with reference  to  the
interpretation  given  by two schools   of philosophical thoughts based on
vEdhA namely the AdhvaithA and the VisishtAdhvaithA  are presented in this
part. By this analysis, we hope to bring out the essential concepts of both the
schools  and validate arguments and  counter-arguments  with  reference  to
VisishtAdhvaithA versus AdhvaithA. 
<p>
<H3><a name="Tat_Tvam_Asi_That_Thou_art"></a>2. "Tat Tvam Asi" - "That Thou art!"</H3>

<p>
The vEdhanta is otherwise called as  Upanishad.  "vEdhanta"  means the  end  of
vEdha.  "Upanishad"  is  the term given to denote it because it is supposed to
be close to the Brahman who is the  only cause of the universe and enlightens
us by explaining the reality, forms,  characteristics,  and  supreme lordship
of Brahman. 
<p>
Of the many  Upanishads  available,  a  famous   one   named "ChandOkya
Upanishad"  has this maxim "Tat Tvam Asi" meaning "That Thou art".  This
verse/maxim occurs in a portion of the  Upanishad  called  as "Sath Vidya".
<p>
<H4><a name="Context_in_Chandogya_Upanishad"></a>2.1. Context  in Chandogya Upanishad</H4>

<p>
UddAlaka Aruni had a son named Swetaketu. It seems that the boy Swetaketu did
not concentrate his mind on the study of vEdha. Therefore his father did not
want him to grow into an "AbhAsa Brahmana" - "he who is a Brahmana by birth but
has failed to study and respect the vEdha". Out of compassion, he asked his son
Swetaketu to undertake the study of vEdhA under a scholar. 
<p>
Swetaketu then went away from his house to study the vEdha under a  scholar for
several  years  as  prescribed.  He  returned  to  his father's  house  after
completing his study. Swetaketu was full of pride. He  lacked  humility.  He
thought  that  he  has  finished studying  everything. 
<p>
On seeing this nature of the son, his father called him and thoughtfully asked
a question - "O my son!  Have you studied  that  thing  (Adesa)  knowing  which
everything  becomes known?" 
<p>
Swetaketu was shocked and replied "Father!  Your question seems  to be
illogical.  Neither  I  know such a thing nor I was taught about such a thing.
If you know please teach me  that!"  
<p>
On hearing this  reply  for the son, the father calmly told him with several
examples - "Son! Have you not seen the mud in front of the potter's house! It
becomes a pot in the hands of  the potter.  If the  mud is known, then all
things made of mud are known! Similarly if you know gold, things made of gold
like ornaments are known. If you know iron, all things made of iron are known!
Like  this, if you  know  an  entity called "Brahman"  then  everything (entire
universe) is known!" 
<p>
Then his father proceeded with the long  Sath  Vidya  explanation, explaining
the Brahman. He said (Sath Eva Sowmya Edamagre Asit) in the  beginning,  which
is  before  creation  of the universe, the "Sath" alone existed. It wished to
become  many  -  which  is  the manifold  universe.  It  created three
divinities and entered into them. From it, the entire universe composed of  all
sentient  and insentient  entities  was created. Sath then entered into all
such things created by  him  from  him  and  became  the  universe.  
<p>
He continued  and  concluded  (Atma Tat Tvam Asi Swetaketo) - "O Son! Sath is
the Atma (Soul). You are That!".

<H3><a name="The_interpretations_of_AdhvaithA_and_VisishtAdhvaithA"></a>3. The   interpretations   of   AdhvaithA   and VisishtAdhvaithA</H3>

<p>
<H4><a name="Advaita"></a>3.1. Advaita</H4>
  
<p>
First,  Let  us examine the verse Tat Tvam Asi from the standpoint of Sri Adi
SankarA who is regarded as the  greatest  preceptor  of the AdhvaithA
School of philosophy. 
<p>
AdhvaithA's key concept is "Nirvisesha Chin MAtram Brahma" meaning the Brahman
is not qualified by  any  characteristics (attributes)  but  only
knowledge-self  is  reality and nothing other than this Brahman is existing.
The Brahman  is  obstructed/covered  by  AvidhyA  (which cannot  be  expressed
in  words  but  is  of  nature  opposite to knowledge-self) and appears as
JeevAtman and  thereby  creating  a false appearance of universe having bbEdha
(difference). 
<p>
Once the  JeevAtman (who is Brahman covered by AvidhyA) realizes that he  is
only   the  Brahman  that  is without  any  attributes  and  only
knowledge-self reality and nothing other than this Brahman is true (merely by
studying and getting knowledge from the AbbEdha Sruthi) , then he attains
liberation called Jeevan-mukti. He gets  out of AvidhyA  thus  gets  liberated
-  He gets his false impression of bbEdha removed  and  this  is  liberation.  
<p>
Sri  Adi  SankarA  has classified  certain verses  of Veda as MahA VAkyAs (eg.,
Tat Tvam Asi) and argues that only these are authoritative.  He  says  that the
Veda  gets  significance  as  authority only when it teaches something which is
not  known  by  any  other  authority.  BbEdha (difference)  is  known  through
sense  organs itself (pratyaksha pramAnam). AbEdha (identity)  is  known  only
through  the  Veda. Therefore the Veda's meaning is only AdhvaithA. The bEdha
Sruthis are not important and only talk about the false bEdha when AvidhyA
covers the Brahman. 
<p>
Sri Adi SankarA  interprets  this  verse  "Tat Tvam  Asi"  to  mean  "The Jeeva
and the Brahman are identical and there is not difference between them and as
such is the  reality". This  is  also  a  literal  interpretation.  Sri  Adi
SankarA has accepted "Swaroopa Iykyam" that is absolute  identity  in  reality
between JeevAtman  and  ParamAtman  (Brahman)  and  has ruled out difference. 
<p>
The verse "Tath Tvam Asi" has three words in it. They are  "Tath", "Tvam"  and
"Asi". 
<p>
"Tath" denotes the Brahman that is held as the absolute cause of the
universe. It is  ascertained  in  this  Sath VidyA  that  Brahman is the
material cause of the universe and the instrumental cause of the universe.
Material cause is the one that undergoes change to become the effect. For
example,  mud  is  the material cause for the pot. The instrumental cause is
the one that brings  out  the  effect  by his wish and action. For example, the
potter is the instrumental cause in making the pot. Here  in  this VEdhAnthA,
the  Brahman is held as both material cause and as the instrumental cause and
the universe is the effect. The  comparison of  mud,  gold,  iron etc denotes
that the Brahman is the material cause. Brahman's wish  to  become  many  and
hence  his  creation denotes that Brahman is the instrumental cause also.
Further it is stated  that  knowing  Brahman,  everything  becomes  known.
This ascertains  the  Brahman  as  material  cause  for  the  universe.
Therefore  the  term  "Tath"  denotes  Brahman who is qualified by
characteristics like being the cause of the universe, greatest  in terms  of
reality,  form  attributes and unparalleled-unsurpassed supreme lordship,
having the entire  universe  as  its  body/mode, having infinite divine
qualities, untouched by all impurities etc. 
<p>
The  term "Tvam" denotes the Jeeva (here Swetaketu) who is finite, bound by its
own karma and suffering in the material world.  These two  entities  appear  to
be  two  different  entities as  their nature/reality  and characteristics are
contradictory in nature to one another. 
<p>
But still, the Veda Verse  "Tath  Tvam  Asi"  conveys identity of the two
entities. Further the "Brahman" is declared as the  material  cause without  a
second entity. This means that we have to negate the qualities of the  two
entities  as  discussed above   and   accept  the  identity  of  them that  is
only  the knowledge-self reality without any attributes/qualities.  Sri  Adi
SankarA  also  quotes  from  the Veda "Niranjanaha etc" and "Nethi Nethi" in
favor of negating the qualities of Brahman. 
<p>
Thus Sri Adi SankarA interprets this verse and argues that  "Brahman  which  is
only  knowledge-self reality is without a second entity - Brahman is not having
any characteristics".  Therefore  AdhvaithA  purely talks  about the identity
of ParamAtman and the JeevAtman and says that the Jagat is "MityA" - "Illusion"
like  the  mirage  in  the desert.  In  this context, the Brahma Sutras in the
fourth pAda of first chapter of KArAnAdhikarana namely  "PrathignyA
Sidherlingam Asmarathyaha",   "Utkramishyata   Yevam   BhAvAtthiowdalomi"   and
"Avasthiterithi  KAsakrtshnaha" are interpreted by Sri Adi SankarA in
accordance with his AdhvaithA philosophy.  
<p>
<H4><a name="Visistadvaita"></a>3.2. Visistadvaita</H4>
 
<p>
We now take up the interpretation given  by  the  VisishtAdhvaithA School  of
philosophy for the Vedic verse "Tath Tvam Asi". 
<p>
As told earlier, "Tath" denotes
"Brahman" and "Tvam" denotes  the  "Jeeva" as   per  the  discussion  above
regarding  individual  qualities associated with them. These two appear
different entities but  the verse  ascertains  identity  of  them.  
<p>
This
identity  is not the identity in nature-reality (Swaroopa) as told by Sri Adi
SankarA. "Tat" denotes the "Brahman" who is attributed with characteristics
like  being the only cause of universe, having the universe as his body etc.
The term "Tvam" also denotes the same "Brahman"  who  is attributed  by  Jeeva
(here Swetaketu) as his body. Therefore "You are That"  means  "O  Jeeva!
(Here  O  Swetaketu!)  You  are  the body/mode  of the Brahman who is the cause
of the universe and has got the entire universe as his body". 
<p>
This  statement
needs  more explanation.  There  is  a  concept  called "SAmAnAdhikaranyam" in
Sanskrit language.  It  is  a  grammatical  concept,  which  needs explaining
now  before explaining in detail the explanation given by VisishtAdhvaithA
regarding  the  verse  "Tath  Tvam  Asi".  The understanding  of this
grammatical concept is required for further discussion.  
<p>
PAnini  explains  this
concept  in  his  grammatical treatise. Bhagavat RAmAnuja follows the same
explanation  and  has explained  this  concept  in  his celebrated work called
"VedArtha  Sangraham" as  "SAmAnAdhikaranyam  Hi  Idvayoho  Padayoho  PrakAraI
dvaya  Mukena  EkArtha  Nishtatvam".  The meaning of this runs as follows:
"When two (or more)  words  denote  the  same  object  by denoting the object
through the each of the different qualities of the object, then those words are
called "Equally denoting words in all  aspects" otherwise called in Sanskrit as
"SAmAnAdhikaranyam". We can understand this concept by an example as follows:
Consider the   Sanskrit   words  "Swethaha  Samudrotbhavaha  Shankaha  mama
vastuhu" All these three words denotes an object that is mine.  It is  a "conch
shell  - Shankaha". The term "Swethaha" denotes the conch shell by its quality
"Whiteness". The term "Samudrotbhavaha" denotes the same object by its quality
of being born from the sea. It is not necessary that those objects which are
white  should  be born  from  sea  and the vice- versa - still here in this
group of words, the words end up to convey the same object by  denoting it by
its  different  qualities/attributes.  Thus  is the concept of
SAmAnAdhikaranyam explained. 
<p>
Now we will apply this  to  the  Veda verse  under
discussion  "Tath  Tvam  Asi". "Tath" is a word that denotes the "Brahman" by
the qualities of Brahman like  being  the cause  of  the universe, having the
universe as his body, infinite etc. "Tvam" is a word again denoting the  same
"Brahman"  by  the quality  of Brahman which is having Swetaketu (Jeeva) as His
body. This  is  how  the  Veda  here  talks  about  both  the   entities
(ParamAtman (Brahman) and the JeevAtman) by SAmAnAdhikaranyam. 
<p>
In  the  example  quoted to understand SAmAnAdhikaranyam, when the conch shell
was denoted by the word "Swethaha", whiteness  is  not the  conch  shell  but
only a quality possessed by the conch shell inseparably. Similarly when the
conch shell  was  denoted  by  the word "Samudrotbhavaha", being born from sea
is not the conch shell but  only a quality possessed inseparably by the conch
shell. 
<p>
Like this, "being the cause of universe", "having the universe as body"
etc are attributes/qualities possessed by the  Brahman  which  are different
from Brahman who possesses them. Similarly, the Jeeva is an  attribute
(body/mode) of Brahman who is different from Brahman but is inseparable from
Brahman.  The  word  "Tath"  denotes  the Brahman  by  his qualities like
"Being the cause of the universe", "having the universe as his body/mode" etc.
The word  "Tvam"  also denotes the same Brahman by his quality of having the
Jeeva as his body/mode.  This  is  how  the "identity" is conveyed by the verse
"Tath Tvam Asi" and it is not  the  identity  of  nature-  reality (swaroopa)
as  told  by Sri Adi SankarA as per AdhvaithA.. 
<p>
Though the AdhvaithA also used
sAmAnadhikaranaya here in this context, it does not  hold  well  as  per  their
identity  in  nature-reality (swaroopa)  of  Brahman  and  Jeeva.  The
AdhvaithA application of  sAmAnadhikaranyam violates the rule of the same as
they negate the qualities to establish identity whereas sAmAnadhikaranyam is
based on qualities as we saw its definition. Therefore  the  application of
sAmAnadhikaranyam  by  VisishtAdhvaithA alone is in accordance with the SAstra.
Thus is the interpretation of "Tath Tvam Asi"  by VisishtAdhvaithA. 
<p>
<p>
<H3><a name="Arguments_amp_Counter_arguments_in_this_Context"></a>4. Arguments &amp; Counter-arguments in this Context</H3>

<p>
Satakopa NamazhvAr, Bhagavat YAmunAchAryA, Sri Bhagavat  RAmAnuja, Srimath
Vedanta  Maha  Desikan are notable personalities who have elaborately dealt
with  refuting  the  AdhvaithA  philosophy  and establishing   VisishtAdhvaithA
philosophy.   Sri  RAmAnuja  has objected AdhvaithA using the Veda  as
authority  and  also  logic wherein he has mentioned seven objections against
AdhvaithA called  Sapta-Vidha- Anupapathi, pointing out mistakes in AdhvaithA.
SwAmi dEsikan   has  dealt  with  refuting  AdhvaithA  and  establishing
VisishtAdhvaithA in  this  celebrated  masterpiece  called  "Satha Dhushini"
wherein  he  has  raised  hundred  objections  against AdhvaithA.  Further  the
same  scholar  of  extraordinary intelligence  and  logical  power  has written
a book called "Para Matha  Bhangam"  wherein  he  refutes  AdhvaithA  and  many
other illogical  schools  of  thought  in  philosophy  and   establishes
VisishtAdhvaithA.  
<p>
We  will  not  go into the details of the above mentioned refutations but will
present some basic  refutations  as essence  from  them.  Now a basic question
arises! - Why should we refute other philosophical schools of  thoughts?  The
answer  is simple.  Our intention  is  only  to ascertain that the only purport
of Veda is VisishtAdhvaithA Sri Vaishnavam  and  it  is  the  only  logically
correct philosophy that has got universal approach that is not at all a
sectarian philosophical school of thought. It is to be noted that  in  debates,
arguments,  and   counter-arguments   favoring something  and  refuting another
thing is the basis to ascertain theories based on a premise. 
<p>
The basic objection in the form of a question against AdhvaithA is "Why
should  the  Brahman  get  obstructed/covered  by  AvidhyA?" 
<p>
AdhvaithA says Brahman is pure knowledge-self  reality  without  a second
entity  and without  any  attributes. AdhvaithA says that AvidhyA cannot be
explained in words  but  it  is  of  the  nature opposed to knowledge-self. How
can the pure knowledge-self-reality Brahman  be  obstructed  by AvidhyA which
is of opposite nature to knowledge? 
<p>
If AvidhyA's nature itself is to be argued that  it  is of obstructing  Brahman
and  create  false  illusion of universe composed  of living  and  non-living
things,  then   a   serious controversy  arises.  That is,  Brahman according
to AdhvaithA is without a second entity. Then from where did this AvidhyA come
to cover  Brahman  and  create  illusion?  If  AvidhyA too has to be accepted
as an entity, then the basis  of  AdhvaithA  gets shaken -"Chin  MAtram
Brahma"  "Brahman  is  without a second entity" is getting contradicted. If
they argue that AvidhyA is not  a  second entity  then it should be an
attribute of Brahman. If so "Nirguna" "Brahman is  without  any attributes"  is
getting  contradicted. 
<p>
Readers!  You  may  just  think  over this  - why should the real Brahman get
itself into the cover of AvidhyA and should  create  a mere  illusion that is
unreal as Jeeva and matter? Why should then after get trapped like this,
attempt for liberation from this?  If liberation  is  needed,  then  the
entity  to  get  liberated  in AdhvaithA is the Brahman itself! Why should the
Brahman suffer in illusion of Jeeva? 
<p>
AdvaithA says the universe is unreal, as it is only  an  illusion. So the
Brahman does not suffer. This is not acceptable because the universe  is  the
creation of the Brahman as per the Veda and the process of creation is
described by it in detail. Saying that  the universe  in  unreal  is
contradictory  to perception through our sense organs also.  The real Brahman
has no necessity to create  an unreal  universe  and  then  attempt to get
liberated from it. Now consider logic. 
<p>
If AvidhyA covers the Brahman and
creates illusion  as Jeeva and matter, then is a part  of  Brahman  covered  or
the entire  Brahman is covered? The Brahman has no parts. If it covers the
Brahman  then   it   should   block   the   self-illuminating
knowledge-self-reality  Brahman.  This "self- illuminating" is not  considered
as an attribute of Brahman as it is told  by  AdhvaithA that  Brahman  has  no
qualities. That means AvidhyA obstructs the knowledge-self-reality (swaroopa)
itself and creates the illusion. Therefore the entity called "Brahman" itself
is lost when  AvidhyA covers  it and cannot be established. 
<p>
AdhvaithA now counter-argues that  the  same  objection  is  possible  to  be
raised against VisishtAdhvaithA  also.  In  VisishtAdhvaithA,  the  JeevAtman
is knowledge-self-reality, finite in nature. The JeevAtman gets bound in  his
Karma  (results  of his action) in the material world and forgets who he is and
thinks he is the body  and  suffers  in  the material  world.  AdhvaithA  says
during  this  phase, the entity "JeevAtman" itself  is  lost  and   it   cannot
be   established. 
<p>
VisishtAdhvaithA  refutes  this  by saying that the karma does not cover the
knowledge-self-finite  reality  of  JeevAtman  but  only makes  his attribute
knowledge to contract according to his karma.  VisishtAdhvaithA   accepts
qualities   possessed   by   Brahman, JeevAtaman and  matter.  Therefore   the
contraction   in   the attribute-knowledge makes the JeevAtman to forget his
reality and suffer in the material world  as per  his  karma.  The  AdhvaithA
cannot  take  this refutation as "answer" for the objection raised by
Visistadvaithins because it does not recognize Brahman with qualities. 
<p>
The Veda says that the Brahman is "Niranjanaha  etc".  Brahman  is Called
"Nirguna" (without attributes) for it does not possess bad qualities or
qualities of material world or qualities  that  Jeeva has  like  karma.  This
does not mean that the Brahman is totally devoid of all qualities. It has
qualities that are  unique  to  it that  are divine and infinite. If Brahman is
to be taken devoid of all qualities, then numerous vEdic verses proclaiming
that Brahman has divine infinite  qualities  become  meaningless.  This  cannot
happen.  Further  "Nethi  Nethi"  in  the Veda does not negate the qualities of
Brahman after saying them. Its meaning is "It is  not only   this   much!
Brahman  is  infinite  with  infinite  divine qualities" 
<p>
If Brahman itself becomes the Jeeva &amp; matter by illusion, then the bad
qualities of Jeeva (being bound by karma, sufferings etc)  and matter (satva,
rajas, tamas and changing nature) are applicable to Brahman.  The  Veda
proclaims  that  Brahman is "Untouched by all impurities". This "proclaim" will
be  meaningless  if  Brahman  by reality  becomes Jeeva/matter. 
<p>
Still the Veda has declared Brahman as the material cause of the universe.
Material cause is the  one that  undergoes  change  to become an effect. The
Veda conveys the nature-reality  of  Brahman  by  the  term  "Satyam".  This
means "NirvikAratvam"  "Unchanging"  nature.  If  the  Brahman  is  also
declared  as material  cause,  don't  you  think   there   is   a contradiction
here?  
<p>
In fact  there  is no contradiction. Before creation, subtle Chith &amp; Achith
entities as  his  body  attributed the  Brahman. The Brahman wished to create
and expanded the subtle entities by giving expanded forms, names, gender, class
etc.  He gave the Chit, form, name etc., as per the Chit's individual karma
that  has  no beginning. Therefore the Brahman is impartial in his creation.
After creating, the Brahman entered into all  the  Chith and  Achith entities
(sentient  and insentient entities) and got attributed by  them  as his  body.
Therefore  the  same  Brahman attributed  by  subtle  Chith-Achith entities
(before creation) as his body became attributed by expanded Chith-Achith
entities  as his  body  (After Creation). This is the reason why the Brahman is
declared as the material cause of the universe. 
<p>
Therefore creation is this which is wished and done by him as expansion of  his
body which  is Chith &amp; Achith entities. As he wished and created, he is also
the instrumental cause of the universe. As the Veda  declares that Brahman is
all-powerful with transcendental divine powers, he needs  no  accessories  in
the process of creation. The Vedas says that the sentient (Chith - Jeeva) and
the  insentient  (Achith  - matter)  and  the Brahman (Iswara - ParamAtman) are
always eternal and has no beginning or middle or end. This ascertains the
subtle and expanded states of his body. It has to be carefully noted that only
the  Brahmans  form  (body)  undergoes  the  contraction and expansion as
destruction and creation  of  universe  and  not  his reality  (Swaroopa).
Therefore  the Brahman is material cause and also is of unchanging nature. Thus
there is no  contradiction.  
<p>
As the  Brahman  is the soul of the universe, he remains untouched by the
qualities of the universe (chith &amp; achith ) as it is his body. The explanation
of the nature of body and soul  in  detail  is  in order  here.  
<p>
Soul  is  the  one  that  eternally  and inseparably  supports controls and
owns the body for its purpose. Body  is the one  that  is eternally and
inseparable supported, controlled and owned by the soul and exists for the
purpose of the soul. This  is the  definition  of  soul and body respectively. 
<p>
Generally when we say "body", the picture of it which comes to a person's  mind
is  "that which has head, legs, hands etc.". If you take the body of asnake,
it does not possess legs hands etc as it is found in human body. The  body's
physical  form  thus  varies  from  species  to species.  Therefore  the
definition  is  not  in  terms  of these physical natures but only of the
definition given above holds good as far as the soul-body relationship is
concerned. 
<p>
The Vedas  talk about identity of Brahman &amp; Universe by AbhEdha Sruthi Verses.
The same  Vedas  talk  about  the  categorical difference between the Brahman &amp;
Universe by BhEdha Sruthi Verses. There appears  that  a contradiction  is
present. But there is no contradiction when both these types of Veda Verses are
synchronized  using  Gataka  Sruthi that talks explicitly the body-soul
relation ship between Brahman  and the universe.
<p>
<p>
When the Gataka Sruthi is used  to  synchronize, the AbhEdha sruthi verses tell
that nothing other than the Brahman qualified by the universe as his body
exists. In the same way when the  Gataka  sruthi  verses  are  used  to
synchornize, the bhEdha sruthi verses tell that  the  Brahman  who  is  the
soul  of  the universe  is  different  from  the universe which is his body -
as body and soul are different  entities  but  they  are  inseparably related.
Therefore  the  entire Veda is without contradiction.
<p>
Thus VisishtAdhvaithA  explains  the verse  "Tath Tvam Asi". AdhvaithA views
regarding the same are refuted and rejected as they are  not in  accordance
with  entire  Veda  and  also contradict  logical reasoning.
