<p>
Visistadvaita admits three fundamental realities individual souls (cit), matter (acit) and Isvara and on the basis of organic relation upholds that the ultimate reality is one as a unity.
<p>
Matter (acit) and individual self (cit) are absolutely dependent on Isvara for
their existence, the dependence being similar to that of body upon self. 
<p>
The universe forms the body of Isvara and He is the universal Self not only of
the unconcious matter (acit) but also of the concious selfs (cit's).
<p>
Body is that which an indwelling self supports and controls for its own services.
<p>
Matter and selfs, being the body of Isvara, are supported and controlled by him
for his own purposes. This view of the relation of inseparability (aprthaksiddhi) 
between body and soul, the universe (cit &amp; acit) and Isvara brings out the intimate
connection between substance and attribute, where Isvara is substance and the
world of matter and selfs form his inseparable attributes.
<p>
This conception of organic unity maybe illustrated by the instance of a mango.
<p>
The color, taste, smell, flesh, shell and the fibre which constitue the whole
fruit can be distinguished as being different from one another. Each element in
the fruit has its own distinctive attributes. Yet when all these are united, the
synthetic whole is regarded as a mango.
<p>
What is common to all the different parts is their inseparable existence.
<p>
Of the various elements, we can regard any particular one as the substantive
element (visesya) and the rest as attributive elements (visesanas).
<p>
Visitadvaita notes that the attributive elements (matter and selfs) and the
substantive element (Isvara) form a synthetic unity.
