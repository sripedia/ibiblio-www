<p>
Sri ManavALa Maamunigal(MM) revered also under 
the names of Sri Vara Vara Munni ,YathIndhra pravaNar
is one of the greatest Sri ViashNavite AchAryAs .
He was born in the village of Kidaram in the year 1370 AD
and ascended paramapadham in the year 1443 AD.He has blessed us 
with 19 granthams . Three of them are in Sanskrit . The rest
are in Tamil and ManipravALam .The three works in Sanskrit are :
YathirAja Vimsathi, Sri DevarAja mangalam and Sri Kaanchi
DevapperumAL SthOthram .His ninteen granthams can be classified 
under three major categories: 
<p>
(A) VyAkyAna Granthams or commentaries on 
the works of earlier AchAryAs like
Sri PiLLai Lokaachaar, PeriyavaacchAN PiLLai
and Thiruvarangatthu Amudanaar .These eight

</pre>
<p>
He lived for 73 years on this earth performing many Kaimkaryams
and undertook many pilgrimages to many Sri VishNavite Dhivya
dEsams . Most of his life was spent however at Srirangam .
The work known as "YathIndhra pravaNa PrabhAvam " records 
the life and accomplishments of this important AchAryA .
His devotion to AchArya RaamAnujA , Swami NammAzhwAr 
and NammperumAL was extraordinary. He spent a significant
portion of his life at Srirangam worshipping Sri Ranganaathan
and peforming KaalakshEpams on AzhwAr-AchAryAL aruLiccheyalkaL.
<p>
When he was 60 , Sri RanganAthA wanted to honor Sri MM
for all his kaimkaryams in spreading the message of 
NaalAyira Dhivya prabhandham . He commanded Sri MM
to conduct an year long lecture series on SatAri Soori's
ThiruvAimozhi at Srirangam in His presence . All the regular
uthsavams for the Lord of Srirangam was cancelled that year ,
while He heard the pravachanams on ThiruvAimozhi based on
all the five commentaries starting from aRAyirappadi .At
the conclusion of these pravachanams , a small boy with
dhivys tEjas came from the back of the sadas and sang
a verse that has come to be known as the Taniyan for
Sri MaNavALa MaamunigaL :
<p>
srIsailEsa dayaapaatram dhIbhakthyAdhi guNArNavam
YathIndhra pravaNam VandhE RamyajAmAtharam munim 
<p>
The audience and Sri MM were wonderstruck after the small boy 
disappeared as fast as he came on the scene . Later ,
through His archakAs , Sri RanganAthA revealed that 
it was He , who appeared as a boy to pronounce the famous
Taniyan for Sri MM , who is considered as a reincarnation
of AchArya RaamAnujA .Earlier at Thirukkurungudi ,
the Lord had appeared before RaamAnujA and requested
for UpadEsams on rahasyArhtams and took on the name of
Sri VaishNava Nambi as a result of these upadEsams .

<p>
Thizhak-kidanthAn ThirunaavIRduaya pirAn 
ThAthar aNNan and Sriranga NaacchiyAr were
blessed with a beautiful son in the year 1370 AD.
This was an year after Swami Desikan ascended to 
Srivaikuntam . Seven years later , Sri AdhivaNN 
SatakOpan was going to be born at Melkote ,
who will initiate this child into utthamAsramam
few years later at Srirangam . 
<p>
The delighted parents gave the name of Azhagiya-
MaNavALan , the name of Lord RanganAthA to their
child . ThaatharaNNan was a great Sri VaishNavite Scholar
himself and initiated his son in to VedAs , VedAngAs and 
Dhivya prabhandhams . The gifted son took on grahasthAsramam
at a young age and moved on to AzhwAr Thirunagari 
to be a disciple under a great dhivya prabhandham
Scholar revered as ThiruvAimozhippiLLai(1307-1410 AD);
latter was a disciple of Koora kulOtthama DaasA( 1265-1365 AD),
who in turn was a dirct disciple of the renowned Sri PiLLai
LOkAcchAr ( 1205-1311 AD), a contemproary of Swamy Desikan .
<p>
ThiruvAimozhi PiLLai (TVP) was also known as Sri SailEsar or
Thirumalai AaLvAn because of his connection to Thirumalai. 
TVP had settled down at AzhwAr Thirunagari and that is where 
Azhagiya MaNavALan studied under him ThiruvAimozhi and 
rahasyArthams .TVP was moved by the Bhakthi of MM 
for AchArya RaamAnujA and appointed MM as the AarAdhakar /
administrator for a special temple he had constructed for 
Bhagavath RaamAnujA . TVP also asked MM to compose a sthuthi 
on AchAryA RaamAnujA . Thus arose YathirAja Vimsathi , 
a moving tribute by MM to Bhagavath RaamAnujA . 
<p>
Soon a son was born to MM and he named the child RaamAnujappiLLai. 
MM continued his studies under TVP , performed AarAdhanam to
AchArya RaamAnujA , worshipped AdhippirAN and Swamy 
NammAzhwAr at AzhwAr Thirunagari until his own Acharyan 
attained the Lord's feet in the year 1410 AD. MM was Fourty
years old at that time. Soon he left with his family
for Srirangam along with his fellow sishyA , RaamAnuja 
Jeeyar , who later became his own key sishyan under the name of
VaanamAmalai Jeeyar . At Srirangam , MM did extensive research
on the granthams of PoorvAchAryaas and conducted kaalakshEpam 
classes. Seven more sishyAs sought his feet as their Achaaryan.
Together , they are known as Ashta Dhig Gajams or the mighty
elephants guarding the eight directions of earth . 
These 8 sishyAs of MM are:
<p>
(1) VaanamAmalai Jeeyar (2) BhattarpirAn Jeeyar 
(3) ThiruvEnkata RaamAnuja Jeeyar (4)Koil aNNan 
(5)PrathivAdhi Bhayankaram aNNan (6) YeRumpiappA 
(7) aAppiLLai (8) AppiLLAr .
<p>
MM adopted SanyAsramam out of virakthi and the desire
to perform kaimkaryam to Sri RanganAthA without any 
theettu interrupting such kaimkaryams .The prEksha manthram was
given to MM by Sri Adhi VaNN satakOpa MahA Desikan . MM
exceleld in his pravachanams and was given the honorific titles of 
Visatha Vaak SikhAmaNI and SarvaJ~na Saarvabhoumar by 
the scholars of his time for his felicity in intrepreting
the Sri Sookthis of AzhwArs and AchAryAs . We referred 
earlier to Sri RanganAthA's honoring MM with a famous Taniyan 
used by the sampradhAyins of ThennaacchArya paramparai 
to this day .
<p>
During his blessed life , MM wrote commentaries for 
the three of the 18 rahasyams of Sri PiLLai LokAcchAr 
( Srivachana BhUshaNam , Tattva thrayam and Mumukshuppadi),
since they are the most prominent . He gave us a vyAkhyAnam
for Azhagiya maNavALa PerumAL NaayanAr's "AchArya Hrudhayam ".
by then , PeriyavAcchAn PiLLai's commentary for PeriyAzhwAr's 
Thirumozhi had been eaten up by white ants .MM recreated 
this commentary for the benefit of future generations. 
He blessed us with commentaries on AruLALap PerumAL 
EmperumAn's Sri Sookthis known as Jn~Ana saaram and 
PramEya Saaram .He wrote a commentary on RaamAnuja 
NooRRanthAdhi of Thiruvarangatthu amudhanAr . Taathparya 
DhIpam arose from MM as a commentary on Bhagavath GitA .
PramANatthirattukaL, ThiruvArAdhana PrayOgam ,IyalcchARRu,
YathirAja Vimsathi , DevarAja MangaLam ,UpadEsa Rathna 
Maalai , ThiruvAimozhi NooRRanthAdhi were also created 
by MM. 
<p>
After these kaimkaryaqms , towards the end of his life ,
MM had such an intense longing (Aarthi) to join 
the lotus feet of AchArya RaamAnujA 
out of his deep virakthi from the life on this earth .,
He composed at this time , his famous Aarthi prabhandham 
one paasuram a day and begged RaamAnujA to call him(MM) 
to his (RaamAnujA's ) sacred feet at Sri Vaikuntam .These
are great and moving expressions of MM's 
NaicchAnusandhANams , which became our 
" NithyAnusandhAnam " for developing VairAgyam and
ruchi for Bhagavath-Bhaagavatha Kaimkaryams .
AchArya RaamAnujA responded to the intense prayer of
MM and called MM to his feet in the year 1443 AD.

<p>
In one of the paasurams of Aarthi Prabhandham ,
MM expressed his own satisfaction with the blessings that 
came his way due to the blessings of AzhwArs, AchAryALs 
and the Lord in a moving way and gave thanks in a 
mind frame similar to Swamy NammAzhwAr in his 
" uNNUm sOr paruhu neer" and 
"ThuvaLil MaamaNI Maadam Pathikams :
<p>
Tennarangar seer arulukkilahaahap peRROm

piRar minukkam poRAmaillA perumayaum peRROmE 
<p>
Here MM reflects with happiness over the amazing grace
of the Lord of Srirangam ,his days spent joyously 
at His KshEthram , his blessings to have 
the Sri Sookthis of NammAzhwAr as his nourishment ,
his obedient pursuit of the path shown by 
Madhurakavi AzhwAr with respect to the revenerence
for his AchAryan, his treasuring of the upadEsams
of poorvAcchAryALs , his reflecting on their
deep meanings as the way to spend his time and discarding 
all other distracting thoughts and living out his life 
with out generating the asooyai of others .
<p>
What a splendid and self-effacing summary of 
his life by this great AchAryan !

<p>
Maamuni, Visatha Vaak sikhaamaNi Sri MaNavALa Maamuni, was born a year after Swami Desikan's passing away and had Sri
Bhashyam kaalakshepam from one of the disciples of Brahma Tantra Swami , the
founder of the ParakAla mutt and direct disciple of Swami Desikan . Maamuni had
the highest regard for Swami Desikan and used to refer to latter with great
affection as " ABHIYUKTHAR " OR THE REVERED ONE . Swami Desikan had in turn the
highest regard for the Achaarya of Maamuni's own Achaarya, Sri Pillai
LokAcharya. 
<p>
Maamuni and the " Srirangam acharyas " interpreted their works with primary
emphasis on the nAlAiyra Divya Prabhandham and did not elect to concentrate on
VedanthA or Saastraas. Swami Desikan and "Kanchi Acharyas" put their primary
emphasis on Vedas, PaancharAtram and Brahma SutrAs commented by RaamAnujA . 
<p>
The distinctly different perspectives of Swami Desikan's and Maamuni's views on
Sri VaishNava tradition have been covered by Dr. Mumme with reference to their
intrepretations on the prime contributions of Sri RamAnujA . Swami Desikan in
his Yathiraaja Sapthadhi salutes RAmAnujA for establishing the VisishtAdvaita
intrepretation of Brahma Sutras through his Sri Bhaashyam. Maamuni saluted
RamAnujaA much more for his Bhakthi for NaMMAzhwAr and Sri RanganAtha than for
his cardinal contribution to establish VisishtAdvaitha VedAnthaa. 
<p>
Maamuni's reverence for Sri RaamAnjua is profound. He followed faithfully his
AchArya's command to spend his time teaching and giving Kaalakshepam on the
hymns of the AzhwArs and pay only " cursory attention " to Sanskritic sources
and Sri Bhaashyam .  Maamuni studied only once Sri Bhaashyam as suggested by
his Acharya and stayed most of his life at Srirangam in obedience to the
suggestion of his AchArya. Earlier ,he had spent a lot of his time at AzhwAr
Thirunagari . There , he composed his first work at the command of his Acharya
on RaamAnuja in Sanskrit known as " YathirAja Vimsathi " . This moving work is
a testament to Maamuni's reverence for RaamAnujA just as Swami Desikan"s
celebrated work known as " YathirAja Sapthadhi " is a moving eulogy of
BhaashyakArar . 
<p>
Maamuni's deep attachment to RaamAnuja is evident from the following facts: (1)
He named his own son, RaamAnuja (2 ) His tribute to the great AchArya in
YathirAja Vimsathi (3) His choice of writing a commentary on RaamAnuja
NyurranthAdhi of Thiruvarangatthu AmudanAr (4 ) modeling his composition (
ThiruvArAdhana Kramam " after the Sanskrit work of RaamAnujA and(5) concluding
his life on this earth with the moving aarthi Prabhandham , where he anguishes
(aarthi ) at staying in this world and expresses his eagerness to reach Sri
VaikuNtam to perform Nitya Kaimkaryam to Parama Padha Naathan . Thus Maamuni's
first and last work were on Acharya RaamAnuja.
<p>
In his work, Upadesa Ratna Maalai , Maamuni pays his tribute to Acharya
RaamAnujA as the establisher of Srimadh Bhagavadh RaamAnuja SiddhAntham and the
command to his disciple , Thirukuruhai PirAn PiLLai to wirite the firdt
commentary on ThiruvAimozhi , which led to the continuation of that tradition
by five successors (viz) ., Nanjeeyar, PeriyavAcchAn PiLLai , Vadakku
Thiruveedhi PiLLai and Vaadhi Kesari Azhahiya MaNavALa jeeyar . Maamuni wonders
loud as to what a loss it would have been, if Sri RamAnujA out of his
compassion for us had not instructed his disciple , Thirukkuruhai PirAn PiLLai,
to write the first commentary on Thiruvaimozhi . 
<p>
The two paasurams of Upadesa Ratna Maalai referring to Maamuni's tribute to
Acharya RaamAnujA as the the founder of "RaamAnuja Darsanam " and his
catalysing the writing of the VyAkyAnam for Thiruvaimozhiare as follows :
