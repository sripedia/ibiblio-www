<p>
In the year 1017 A.D., Ramanuja was born in the village of Perumbudur, about
twenty-five miles west of Madras. His father was Kesava Somayaji and his mother
was Kantimathi, a very pious and virtuous lady. Ramanuja's Tamil name was Ilaya
Perumal. Quite early in life, Ramanuja lost his father. Then he came to
Kancheepuram to prosecute his study of the Vedas under one Yadavaprakasha, a
teacher of Advaita philosophy.
<p>
One day while taking a massage, Yadavacarya was explaining to
ramanuja a sutra "tasya yatha kapyasam pundarikamevamaksini"(Chandogya 1.6.7),
saying that according to Sri Sankara, the two eyes of Pundariksa are like two
lotuses which are red like the nates of a monkey. 
<p>
On hearing this interpretation with the unbecoming and low simile, Ramanuja's
soft heart, tender by nature and softened by devotion, melted and as he was
massaging, tears rolled down from the corners of his eyes like flames of fire
and fell on the thigh of Yadava. Looking up at the touch of the hot tears,
Yadava understood that something troubled his disciple. Ramanuja explained his
dismay at hearing such an unbecoming explaination from his guru. 
<p>
He thought it sinful to compare with the posterior of a monkey the eyes of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead - who is endowed with all gracious qualities and
who is the repository of all the beauty of the universe. Yadava was angry at
the boy's audacity and told him to explain the verse if he could. Ramanuja
analysed the word kapyasam to mean `blossomed by the sun' and the verse to mean
"The eyes of that Golden Purusa are as lovely as lotuses blossomed by the rays
of the sun." 
<p>
After a few more such incidents when Ramanuja corrected his guru, Yadavacarya
thought him to be a threat to the Sankarite line and plotted to kill him. Later
it came to pass that Yadavacarya was to become the disciple of Sri Ramanuja. 
<p>
Yamunacarya the formost exponent of Vaisnava<a href="/action=edit&id=Vaisnava" class=wikipageedit>?</a> philosophy of the time, knowing of
his extraordinary ability and purity, called for Sri Ramanuja with the intent
of placing him in charge of the mission after his disappearance. Ramanuja was
on his way to see Yamunacarya when he received the news of Yamunacarya's
departure from the world. Arriving at Srirangam, Ramanuja went to have his last
darshana of that great soul. There he noticed three of Yamunacarya's fingers
were clenched. 
<p>
Ramanuja then made three vows:
<p>
<UL >
<li>He would make the people surrender to God and initiate them by the pancasamskara. 
<li>He would write a commentary on the Vedantasutra which was later called Sri Bhashya. 
<li>He would perpetuate the name of Parasara Muni the aouthor of the Visnu Purana.  
</UL>
<p>
Later Sri Ramanuja took sannyasa and travelled throughout India vigorously
defeating atheists and impersonalists by preaching the Vasistadvaita doctrine.
He never failed to win over a rival in spiritual disputations. 
<p>
<H3><a name="His_teachings"></a>2. His teachings</H3>
 
<p>
His philosophy is <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Visistadvaita.html" class=wikipagelink>Visistadvaita</a>. Brahman is Narayana - (cit-acit-isvara),
Narayana with Laksmi - (transcendental form), Four Vyuha forms, Vaibhava forms.
The qualities of Brahman are both nirguna and saguna. The soul is real,
eternal, individual, not omnipresent, not independent of Isvara but part.
Isvara is the efficient cause of creation. It is from His will out of delight.
The cause of bondage is beginningless karma. The process of release is Bhakti
based on <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Pancaratra.html" class=wikipagelink>Pancaratra</a> and Visnu purana followed by detached karma that brings
jnana - Prapatti. The goal is to attain the same nature of Isvara and
companionship with Him. He does not return and has no power of creation, etc.
