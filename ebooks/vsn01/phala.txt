<font color="#FF0000">itiidaM kiirtaniiyasya keshavasya mahaatmanaH | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">naamnaaM sahasraM divyaanaam asheshheNa prakiirtitam || (1) </font>

Thus, the thousand divine names of Bhagavan Keshava, the Supreme who is pre-eminently worthy of
being paraised, have been sung in their entirety (in all their bearings). These divya namas are
meant to be recited both here and in all the upper worlds including the transcendent abode
(heaven), inasmuch as they pertain to the MahAtma, the supreme being, Kesava.

<font color="#FF0000">ya edaM shrunyaa-Nityam yashchapi parikirtayaet | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">Naa-aShubham praptyunaat kinCHIT-somutreH cha manavaH || (2) </font>

Nothing inauspicious (or obnoxious) will befall the one who devoutly listens to the recital of
this sahasranama stotra daily and (the more so) the one who recites it wherever it may be,
whether in this world or the worlds beyond.

<font color="#FF0000">veedantago brahmana-asyat Kshatriyo vijayee bhavaet | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">vaishyo dhana-SamRidhasya-chhuudra-sukhamvaapnuyaat || (3) </font>

If the person who chants these names is a brahmin he will attain the knowledge of the vedanta;
if a kshatriya, he will become a victorious warrior; if a vaisya, he will acquire immense
wealth, and if a sudra, he will remain happy.

<font color="#FF0000">dharmaarthii praapnuyaad-dharmam.arthaarthii cha.arthamaapnuyaat | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">kaamaanava.apnuyaatkaamii prajaarthii cha-apnuyaat prajaaH || (4) </font>

If a person recites the holy names with a desire abiding in dharma, he will achieve it;
if he is desirous of wealth he will get wealth; if he is after the pleasures of life
he will get them all; if he wants to have progeny, he will have it. In short, those who
recite these holy names of the Lord will reap the desired fruits without fail.

<font color="#FF0000">bhaktimaan yaH sadotthaaya shuchistadgatamaanasaH | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">sahasraM vaasudevasya naamnaametatprakiirtayet || (5) </font>

Well, take the case of a staunch devotee who gets up in the morning and purifies himself
through bath followed by daily observance of the prescribed rites and rituals and then
recites the thousand names of Lord Vasudeva, with a mind firmly fixed on him. [The following
3 sloks 6-8 spell out the benefits (fruits) enjoyed by such a person]

<font color="#FF0000">yashaH praapnoti vipulaM GYaatipraadhaanyameva cha | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">achalaaM shriyamaapnoti shreyaH praapnotyan.uttamam || (6) </font>

He gains great reputation and is reckoned as the foremost among his kith and kin. He
acquires abundant wealth (in this world) and keeps it in tact while, in the other world
he enjoys everlasting bliss, (anuttamam sreyah - salvation)

<font color="#FF0000">na bhayaM kvachidaapnoti viiryaM tejashcha vindati | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">bhavatyarogo dyutimaan-bala-ruupa-guNaanvitaH || (7) </font>

Free from fear (through any source) and sickness (at any time), the chanter acquires valor,
power and strength and is endowed with a healthy body, noble traits and dazzling brilliance.

<font color="#FF0000">rogaarto muchyate rogaa-dbaddho muchyeta bandhanaat | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">bhayaan.muchyeta bhiitastu muchyetaapanna aapadaH || (8) </font>

The one afflicted by sickness will get rid of it, the one, in shackles of sorts will get
disentangled while the one stricken by fear, will become free from it and the one beset with
difficulties, will get absolved of them (whatever be their magnitude).

<font color="#FF0000">durgaaNyatit aratyaashu purushhaH purushhottamam | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">stuvan naama sahasreNa nityaM bhakti samanvitaH || (9) </font>

That person who praises with devotion the supreme being Purusottama through the daily recital
of these thousand names, surmounts, in no time, the seemingly insuperable difficulties one and
all. [The emphasis here is on the unflinching devotion of the chanter towards the Supreme being
with the sole object of attaining him, which results in the automatic disappearance of all his
erstwhile difficulties though not solicited as such, by the chanter (even as darkness vanishes 
as a matter of course, with the induction of light)].

<font color="#FF0000">vaasudevaashrayo martyo vaasudevaparaayaNaH | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">sarvapaapa-vishuddhaatmaa yaati brahma sanaatanam || (10) </font>

The one, who seeks out Lord Vasudeva, looking upon Him as the highest goal to be attained,
gets cleansed (purged) of all sins. With a mind thus purified, the chanter attains the
eternal Brahman

<font color="#FF0000">na vaasudeva bhaktaanaam ashubhaM vidyate kvachit | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">janma mRityu jaraavyaadhi bhayaM naiva api jaayate || (11) </font>

Nothing inauspicious ever befalls the devotees of Vasudeva nor do they have any fear from the
cyclic operation of birth, disease, old age and death any longer. (with the certain prospect of
attaining Him in heaven at the end of the current span of life).

<font color="#FF0000">imaM stavama-dhiiyaanaH shraddhaabhaktisamanvitaH | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">yujyetaatmaa sukhakshaanti shriidhRiti smRiti kiirtibhiH || (12) </font>

The chanter of this hymn, with zeal and devotion, is blest with the happy realization of the
essential nature of the self (svasvarUpa), besides the qualities of serenity, mental stability,
unfailing memory and great fame and wealth (put to beneficial use).

<font color="#FF0000">na krodho na cha maatsaryaM na lobho na ashubhaa matiH | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">bhavanti kRita puNyaanaaM bhaktaanaaM purushhottame || (13) </font>

Neither anger nor jealousy, neither avarice nor unholy thooughts taint the minds of the true
devotees of Purusottama, who have to their credit many a virtuous deed.

<font color="#FF0000">dyauH sa-chandraarka nakshatraa khaM disho bhuur mahodadhiH | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">vaasudevasya viiryeNa vidhRitaani mahaatmanaH || (14) </font>

The firmament, the Moon, the Sun and the Stars, the Sky, the directions, earth and the vast ocean
are one and all, propped up by the supreme valor of vasudeva.

<font color="#FF0000">sa sura asura gandharvaM sayaksho.raga raakshasam | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">jagad vashe vartatedaM kRishhNasya sacharaacharam || {15}  </font>

This world with all its contents, the sentient beings and non-sentient things, the gods, the asuras,
and gandharvas, the yaksas, nagas and raksasas, is under the supreme control of Sri Krishna.

<font color="#FF0000">indriyaaNi mano buddhiH sattvaM tejo balaM dhritiH | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">vaasudeva.atmakaany aahuH kshetraM kshetraGYa eva cha || (16)  </font>

The several sense organs, the mind, the intellect, (the quality of) sattva, power, strenght, firmness
as well as the body as a whole and the individual souls - all of them have Vasudeva as their AtmA (inner
soul) [Vasudevatmakani means that all of them (prakriti and the jivas) constitute his body]. sastra should
be supplied as subject of the predicat ahuh to read the shastras say.

<font color="#FF0000">sarvaagamaanaa.m aachaaraH prathamaM parikalpate | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">aacharaprabhavo dharmo dharmasya prabhur achyutaH || (17)  </font>

Right conduct has been laid down as the most important, the foremost of all the dharma revealed by the
shastras. Right conduct gives rise to dharmas. Bhagavan Acyuta is the deity propitiated by dharma, 
who not only helps in one's adherence of dharma, but also awards the fruits thereof.

<font color="#FF0000">RishhayaH pitaro devaa mahaabhuutaani dhaatavaH | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">jaNgamaa jaNgamaM chedaM jagat naaraayaN.odbhavam || (18)  </font>

The sages, manes (pitrs - departed ancestors), gods, the great elements and their effects, the mobile
beings and the immobile things comprising the entire universe, have all emnated from nArAyanA.

<font color="#FF0000">yogo GYaanaM tathaa saa.nkhyaM vidyaaH shilpaadi karma cha | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">vedaaH shaastraaNi viGYaanam etat sarvaM janaardanaat || (19)  </font>

The knowledge of Yoga, sankhya, the several branches of learning, arts, works, vedas, sastras - all
these spring from Bhagavan Janardana.

<font color="#FF0000">eko vishhNur mahadbhuutaM pRithag bhuutaany anekashaH | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">trii.n lokaan vyaapya bhuutaatmaa bhu.nkte vishvabhug avyayaH || (20)  </font>

Lord Visnu is the unique deity of incomparable excellence, in that He pervades the great elements
of multifarious kinds and the three worlds (of souls). He is their AtmA and their protector. And
yet he stands head and shoulders above them all and is not the least tainted by their defects.

<font color="#FF0000">imaM stavaM bhagavato vishhNorvyaasena kiirtitam | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">paThedya ichchhet purushhaH shreyaH praaptuM sukhaani cha || (21) </font>

That person who desires to obtain supreme bliss in the yonder heaven as well as the pleasures
of this world should read the stotra of Bhagavan Visnu, sung by the great sage Vyasa.

<font color="#FF0000">vishveshvaram ajaM devaM jagataH prabhavaapyayam | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">bhajanti ye pushkaraakshaM na te yaanti paraabhavam || (22)  </font>

The lotus eyed is the birthless, Supreme deity, the sovereign lord of the universe and the cause of
creation and dissolution of the universe. Those who sing his praise will never meet with disrespect
or discomfiture of any kind.

<font color="#FF0000">|| na te yaanti paraabhavam oM nama iti || </font>

Salutation to the lord of all auspiciousness, never will they meet with any disrespect from any source.

<font color="#FF0000">Arjuna uvaacha -

<font color="#FF0000">bhaktaanaam anuraktaanaaM traataa bhava janaardana || (23) </font>

Arjuna said &quot;O Janardana, the greatest of gods, with broad eyes like lotus petals and lotus on your
navel ! May you be the protector of your loving devotees.

<font color="#FF0000">shrii bhagavaanuvaacha -

<font color="#FF0000">|| stuta eva na saM shaya oM nama iti || </font>

Bhagavan said: Arjuna, a person may, of course, be desirous of lauding me by reciting all the thousand
names. But on my part, I feel satisfied with the chanting of just one sloka (out of the hundred and odd
slokas). There is no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. Salutations to the auspicious lord (Om)

<font color="#FF0000">vyaasa uvaacha -

<font color="#FF0000">|| shrii vaasudeva namo.astuta oM nama iti || </font>

Vyasa said: Vasudeva, all the three worlds become viable only because they are pervaded by you the all-
pervading. You are indeed the abode of all beings. Salutations to you O Vasudeva.

<font color="#FF0000">paarvaty uvaacha -

<font color="#FF0000">paThyate panDitair nityam shrotum-ichchhaam-yaham prabho || (26) </font>

Parvati said: Pray spell out the easy method by which the thousand names of Lord Vishnu could be deemed
to have been recited by learned persons daily. I wish to be enlightened by you My Lord.

Isvara said: Here you are, Sri Rama's name, being the delightful source of mental exhilaration, I take
great delight in reciting it repeatedly, any length of time. Rama's name is indeed on par with the
thousand names of Lord Vishnu spelt out in this Hymnal, O my blessed lady.
</div>

<font color="#FF0000">|| shrii raamanaama varaanana oM nama iti || </font>

Salutations to Rama's name denoted by Om.

Brahma said: Salutations to Bhagvan who is eternal, who has a thousand forms, a thousand feet, (a 
thousand) eyes, (a thousand) heads, (a thousand) thighs and (a thousand) arms and who is the eternal 
Purusa, having a thousand names. Salutations to him who is sustainer of a thousand crores of aeons.

<font color="#FF0000">|| sahasrakoTii yugadhaariNa oM nama iti || </font>

Salutations to the auspicious lord denoted by OM, the (mighty) sustainer of a thousand crores of aeons.

<font color="#FF0000">tatra shriirvijayo bhuutirdhruvaa niitir matir mama || (29) </font>

Sanjaya said: Where Sri Krishna, the lord of yoga is and where stands pArtha (Arjuna) holding the
(dexterous) bow there and there alone shall abide permanently prosperity, victory, glory and
righteousness (moral ethics). This is my conclusion (considered opinion).

<font color="#FF0000">shrii bhagavaan uvaacha - </font>

Shri Bagavan said: Unto those people who meditate solely on me (as the repository of all auspicious
traits and the sovereign master of the universe), I bear the burden of vouchsafing the yoga (of
attaining me) and ksema (retaining them in that position without sliding back).

<font color="#FF0000">paritraaNaaya saadhoonaaM vinaashaaya cha dushha kRitaam | </font>
<font color="#FF0000">dharma saMsthaapanaarthaaya saMbhavaami yuge yuge || (31) </font>

Bhagavan continued: Whether afflicted by dire distress or poignant grief or shattered by confusion due
to fright or tormented by other maladies, if the victims, in each case, do but spell the name 
nArAyanA, they not only get rid of all these troubles but also attain everlasting happiness.

<font color="#FF0000">kaayena vaacaa manasEndriyairvaa buddhya aatmanaavaa prakrteh svabhaavaat |

Whatever act I perform under the influence of matter (prakrti), with my (elemental material) body or
word, mind or sense organs, intellect or (embodied) self (atma), I offer all that, in humble dedication
at the feet of nArAyanA, the supreme lord.
