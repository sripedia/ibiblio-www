<p>
What is other than <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Dravya.html" class=wikipagelink>dravya</a> is adravya or non-substance. It is defined as that which cannot be the substratum of anything else and which is necessarily dependent on dravya.
<p>
A mere quality of an entity cannot be regarded as adravya. It should be such a quality or property of a substance that it does not become a substrate for another quality and is integrally related to the substance.
<p>
For example, jnana<a href="/action=edit&id=Jnana" class=wikipageedit>?</a> or knowledge is a quality of the <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Jiva.html" class=wikipagelink>jiva</a>, but jnana though inseparably related to the jiva, <i>is not</i> adravya, because it serves as a substrate for its modifications. rupa<a href="/action=edit&id=Rupa" class=wikipageedit>?</a> or color as a quality <i>is</i> adravya since it is not the substrate for any other qualities and at the same time is inseparable from the substance in which it inheres.
<p>
In view of the above, adravya is also defined as that which cannot admit conjunction with another quality.
<p>
There are ten fundamental adravyas (as enumerated by <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/desikan">Vedanta Desikan</a> )
<OL >
<li>Sattva
<li>Rajas
<li>Tamas
<li>sabda (Sound)
<li>sparsa (touch)
<li>rupa (color)
<li>rasa (taste)
<li>gandha (Odor)
<li>samyoga (conjunction)
<li>sakti (potency)
</OL>
<p>
The terms dravya and adravya are comprehensive in character and mutually exclusive. What is a dravya can never be an adravya and vice-versa.
