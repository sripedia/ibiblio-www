<H3><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</H3>

Every religion has its rites and rituals to help
us one along the journey of life . We flutter like
" the candle in the wind " during our stay on this earth 
until we reach the Lord's abode . Hindusism has 
a most beautiful set of FOURTY SAMSKARAS for 
our spiritual welfare from the time of conception to 
the final moment on His LeelA vibuthi . These samskArAs 
form the core of a Hindu"s life . 
<p>
These are rites performed to help the human being 
to purify their body and mind in " seen and unseen
ways ." The seen aspect is the creation of a shining new 
object by removing dirt and grime from a tarnished object
with detergents . The unseen aspect , according to one
AchAryA is that the SamskArAs are like the sanctification 
of the water by "charging" it with the Veda mantrAs for 
punyAvAchanam and Udaka sAnthi rites . 
<p>
There is a proper age and time in human life to perform
these samskArAs . If that is followed , it is believed that 
the efects( benefits ) of the samskArAs are the greatest .
Out of compassion for us , the laggards , our merciful 
sAsthrAs give us " substitute periods ( kaalAs ) " ,
if one misses the appropriate time recommended by 
the SAsthrAs . 
<p>
The life of the Hindu rotates around these series of 
life cycle rituals referred to as SamskArAs . They are rooted in
the eternal VedAs . The minimum number of SamskArAs 
to be observed by men and women vary . Manu , Gautama,
ApasthampA , Yaj~navalkyA and other kalpa sutra kaarAs 
have written extensively on these samskArAs and the proper
procedure to perform them to gain maximum seen and
unseen benefits . Great AchAryAs of Ahobila mutt like 
the 25th , 26th , 27th , 42 nd and the current Jeeyars have
written extensively and have left great ahnika granthAs .
These granthAs are known as SadAchaara NirNayam 
and dwell at great length on the nityA and naimmitthika 
karmAs . I will write about the SamskArAs in this and 
subsequent postings .
<p>
<H3><a name="What_is_a_samskaaraa"></a>2. What is a samskaaraa ?</H3>

<p>
According to the Tarka sAsthrAs , the word SamskArA is 
defined as " an impression on the memory " .Steady pracise
of scriptural injunctions establishes firm tracks in the memory 
so that the practitioner does not swerve from the correct path .
According to another defenition , SamskArA means " betterment "
( Sams ) of a thing ( kaaram ) . The cleansing process set in motion 
by the observance of SamskArAs leads to the betterment 
of life and qualifies a person for spiritual upliftment .
<p>
<H3><a name="Samskaara_amp_the_aatma_gunaas"></a>3. Samskaara &amp; the aatma gunaas </H3>

<p>
The practise of SamskArAs develop eight auspicious 
guNAs ( attributes ) that help to remove the samsAric ills
caused by the sensory attachments . Since these guNAs 
have an impact on the soul , they are described as
Aathma GuNAs . A steady practise of the samskArAs leading to 
the acquisition of the aathma guNAs helps a person to 
attain the state of akhanda aathma anubhavam , the 
supreme experience exemplified by the tenets of 
Sri VisishTaadvaitham that celebrates the " Oneness" 
of the supreme being ( brahman ) , who is qualified by 
" the gross and subtle forms of the sentient and insentient
entities , at the two states of manifestation and dissolution
of the universe " . The akhandAthama anubhavam 
extolled by AzhwArs and AcharyAs in their granthams 
is the elaboration oft he concept that " the Lord is the soul 
and that the world of men and matter constitutes His body " .
<p>
<H3><a name="The_eight_aathma_gunaas"></a>4. The eight aathma gunaas </H3>

<p>
The names of the eight aathma guNAs are worthy of
being commented upon especially at this time , when we
went through some difficult times : 
<p>
1. DAYAA or univeral compassion and love for all living beings
2. KSHAANTHI or tolerance of ill-wishers
3. ANUSUYAI or freedom from jealousy or rancour
4.SAUCHAM or body cleanliness
5. ANAAYASAM or relaxed state characterized by EASE IN 
RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS 
6. MANGALAM or inner happiness radiating as harmonious 
conduct 
7 . AKAARPANYAM or generosity of spirit and time 
8 . ASPRUHAM or detached state of mind arising from a 
dispassionate nature 
<p>
<H3><a name="Nishekaathi_smasaanaantha_samskaaraas"></a>5. Nishekaathi smasaanaantha samskaaraas</H3>

<p>
The samskArAs cover the life span of a Hindu rom the time
of formation (conception ) of the embryo (nishEkam ) to
the time of cremation in the burning ghaat (smasaanam ) . 
Agni is an indispensable part of the samskArAs that cover 
the entire span of on's life . Agni is therefore saluted as a
witness to the samskArAs . Even cremation is considered 
as an offering of the ghee-smeared body to Agni as the
ultimate offering .
<p>
<H3><a name="Place_and_time_for_samskaaraas"></a>6. Place and time for samskaaraas</H3>

<p>
Some of the samskArAs are not time consuming ,
whereas the others are elaborate and require continous
performance over many days . Some of the samskArAs are
done at home , whereas the others need a spacious site 
as well as extensive time for the collection of the rquired utensils 
representing the body of Yaj~na VarAha Murthy , ingredients
( saamagris ) and helpers ( rthviks ) . 
<p>
A number of samskArAs --OupAsanA , AgnihOthrA and 
the pancha MahA Yaj~nAs -- have to be performed daily .
Two other samskArAs -- Darsa PoorNa Maasa and SthAlipAkA --
have to be practised twice a month . ParvaNi srArdhA has to be
conducted once a month . Rest of the samskArAs have to be 
performed once a year or atleast once in one's life time . 
<p>
<H3><a name="Classifications_of_the_samskaaraas"></a>7. Classifications of the samskaaraas </H3>

<p>
The fourty samskaaraas can be split into the following 
six categories :
<p>
1. a set of seven starting from GarbhadhAnA to Chudakramaa
2. Another set of seven starting from UpanayanA to VivAhA 
3. A group of five Yaj~nAs known as Pancha MahA Yaj~nAs
4. A set of seven Paka Yaj~nAs
5. A group of seven Havir Yaj~nAs
6. Another group of seven Soma Yaj~nAs 
<p>
<H3><a name="Before_upanayanaa"></a>8. Before upanayanaa</H3>

<p>
All the seven samskArAs prior to Upanayanaa are
performed by the parents on behalf of the child , since
it has not reached the stage of discriminating knowledge .
These are :
<p>
<H4><a name="Garbhadhaanam"></a>8.1. Garbhadhaanam : </H4>

<p>
The placement of the seed by the husband in 
the wife's womb is known as GarbhAdhAnam .From the moment 
the embryo forms , the life cycle rituals of the Hindu begins . The married
couple have to conceive in a state of mind tamed and purified 
by the Vedic rites of Saanthi KalyANam . This way , they can
conceive a child with auspicious qualities . The " Jaayamaana 
KatAksham " of Sriman NaarAyaNaa helps towards the birth 
of great devotees such as DhruvA . In his outstanding 
Sri Desika Darsana PanchAngam released by Sri SevA
SwamigaL , he points out that the days , when the following
stars are inascendance are auspicious for garbhAdhAnam :
Asvini , UtthirAdam , Satayam , Uttaram , Hastham ,
Chitthirai and SvAthi .
<p>
<H4><a name="Pumsavana_samskaaraa"></a>8.2. Pumsavana samskaaraa : </H4>

<p>
This is to be performed 
during the third month of pregnancy , which is much before 
quickening of the growth of the embryo .
<p>
<H4><a name="Simanthonayana_samskaaraa"></a>8.3. Simanthonayana samskaaraa</H4>

<p>
This samskArA (hair parting of the pregnant mother)
has to be performed either in the sixth month or in
the eighth month of pregnancy . One should not combine
the Pumsavana wiht the SimanthOnayana samskaaram ,
as is being done these days . These samskArAs are
abandoned these days . These two are purificatory rites 
sanctioned by the VedAs for the proper growth of the fetus
inside the womb of the mother . Therefore , these samskArAs
should not be abandoned .
<p>
<H4><a name="Jaatha_karmaa"></a>8.4. Jaatha karmaa</H4>

<p>
This is performed soon after the child's birth. The tongue of
the newly -born is touched thrice with ghee to the accompaniment of 
appropriate Vedic manthrAs seeking protection and long life
for the newly born .
<p>
<H4><a name="Naamakaranaa"></a>8.5. Naamakaranaa</H4>

<p>
This fifth samskArA dals with the naming of the child on its 
eleventh day of its birth ( vide : PeriyAzhwAr's celebration
of Sri KrishNA's NaamakaraNam in his Thirumozhi ) .
There are strict rules in choosing the name for the newly
born based on the constellation at the time of birth or the time
of the day , when the child is born . As PeriyAzhwAr has instructed us ,
auspicious names associated with Sriman NaarAyaNA and
MahA Lakshmi or great AchAryAs should be chosen for the baby
with the lessons learned from AjaamiLOpAkhyANam .
<p>
<H4><a name="Annapraasanam"></a>8.6. Annapraasanam</H4>

<p>
This deals with the feeding of the baby for the first time
with solid food at the age of six months . This samskArA is 
performed generally at the local temple .The parents recite
manthrAs , while they feed the child . It is a beautiful sight 
to observe this ritual at GuruvAyoor temple .
<p>
<H4><a name="Chudakarmaa"></a>8.7. Chudakarmaa</H4>

<p>
The last of the pre-upanayana samskArA is chuda Karmaa
for a male child , when a tuft or sikhA is created . The sikhA
is created with the samkalpA to the Lord and hence , should 
not be removed impulsively or with abandon . The purpose of 
the SikhA is to protect the most sensitive nerve center on the top
of the head known as Brahma ranthram from any abnormal 
vibrations . SikhA will also qualify the BrahmachAri or celibiate
for the prformance of Vedic rites such as SamidhAdhAnA or 
the offering of palaasa twigs to the fire as apart of the daily
observance . 
<p>
The householder has to ring his sikhA after his bath every day to offer
sikhOdhakA or the water from his tuft to his pithrus or ancestors.
Without the sikhA , no water from the tuft can be offered . In the Hindu
way 
of life , only the sanyAsi has no sikhA , since he has to shave 
his hair at the time of his entering sanyAsAsramam . This is allowed
for this asramamam , since the sanyAsi is free from 
the observance of offerings for his ancestors .
<p>
<H3><a name="Upanayanam"></a>9. Upanayanam</H3>

<p>
A child normally starts schooling at the age of five. When it
reaches the age of eight , it possesses a grip on the language 
and therefore is considered eligible for receiving Vedic Instruction .
A sacred thread ceremony known as Upanayanam is performed 
by the father and the boy is blessed with the initiation into reciting
the sacred Gayathri Manthram . Next , his Vedic instruction begins
with the proper guru . 
<p>
Upanayana means bringing one close to the guru or the teacher ,
who initiates the child into Veda vidyA . The boy learns one VedA with 
its limbs (angAs ) . It takes 12 years to complete the learning of 
one Veda with its angAs . The boy stays in the house of the guru
and observes the ancient practise of gurukulA and performs services
to the guru and his family in return for receiving his education . He also
practises celibacy ( Brahmacharyam ) during these 12 years . 
Brahmacharya is the first of the four aasramAs for a Hindu .
The recitation of the VedAs with swarAs (proper intonations ) 
from a qualified guru is the goal of thsi aasramA .
<p>
The BrahmachAri observes four addiitonal samskArAs 
during this period of receiving Vedic instruction . These 
four samskArAs are linked with the completion of each of
the four khAndAs (sections ) of the individual VedA .
<p>
For instance , a celibiate receiving instruction in KrishNa Yajur
VedA has to complete the four khAndAs of PrAjApathya , 
Soumya , AagnEya and VaisvadEva . During the completion 
of each of the four khAndhAs , the brahmachAri observes 
the samskArAs of each of the above four khAndAs . Similarly ,
Rg VedA has a set of four samskArAs known as MahAnAmni ,
MahAupanishad and two GodhAna vratAs that have to be 
performed by the student . Recent postings on UpAkarmA
relate to the Khanda rishi tarpaNam connected with our 
thanks giving to the rishis of the khAndams . 
<p>
At the conclusion of the samskArAs associated with the final
khAndhA of the VedA , the bachelor is adjudged as having 
completed hisVedic instructions successfully . He offers his
homage to his guru and returns home to perform a samskArA 
known as samAvartanA , which literally means return to home
at the end of his studies . He takes a ritual bath called SnAnA 
and is thereafter he is known as SnAtakA , who has completed his
gurukula vaasam .He goes on pilgrimage to Kaasi kshEthram
and on return from that journey is ready for marriage or VivAham .
He is now ready to enter into the second aasramam known as 
GrihasthA ( house-holder ) . From UpanayanA to VivaahA , we have 
thus witnessed seven samskArAs . After VivAhA , he is expected
to observe BrahmacharyA for one year and thereafter , he is qualiifed 
to perform the samskArA of garbhAdhAnam associated with 
the conception of a child . 
<p>
VivAhA for women is equivalent to the Upanayanam ceremony .
After VivAham , she participates in all the Yaj~nAs with her 
husband as sahadharmachAriNi . Hence , VivAham is called
SahadharmiNi SamprayOgam . It may be pointed out that both
the VivAham and Upanayanam should be conducted during 
the UttarAyaNa puNya kaalam . I have covered the individual 
stages of Vedic VivAham in other postings connected with
AanDAL's VaraNamAiyram earlier ..
<p>
<H3><a name="Pancha_MahA_Yaj_nAs"></a>10. Pancha MahA Yaj~nAs</H3>

<p>
We have so far covered 14 samskArAs for the period leading 
up to VivAham .In the married state , the householder has to 
observe five more samskArAs daily and they are known as 
the five great yaj~nAs ( pancha mahA yaj~nAs ) .The performance 
of these five samskArAs helps the householder to discharge 
his debts to DevAs , his ancestors and all living beings .
<p>
These pancha MahA Yaj~nAs are :
<p>
1. Brahma Yaj~nam , which is performed through the recitation
of the VdAs and helps to discharge the debt to Vedic rishis or
manthra drashtAs . They collected the Veda samhithAs through
their spiritual powers .
<p>
2. Deva Yaj~nA, which requires the performance of pujAs 
and Yaj~nAs for Gods .
<p>
3. Pithru Yaj~nAs : The debt to one's ancestors is discharged 
through the offering of pindAs during the tarpaNAs as oblations.
<p>
4. Maanushya Yaj~nA : The athithi sathkAram or feeding of 
one's guest with respect , discharges one of his debts to 
the community .
<p>
5. BhUta Yaj~nA : This samskArA consists of feeding 
the living entities other than human beings . Offerings are made 
to them as they are an extended set of human family .
<p>
We have described 19 samskArAs so far .The remaining 21 fall
into three distinct subsets : Paaka , Havir and sOma Yaj~nAs . 
There are a seven of each of the three subsets . Brief descriptions
of these 21 yaj~nAs will be presented here. The various kalpa
sUtrAs and GrihyAsUtrAs describe these Yaj~nAs in great detail .
<p>
<p>
<H3><a name="Paaka_Yaj_nAs"></a>11. Paaka Yaj~nAs</H3>

<p>
These are small yaj~nAs . The nams of these are :
1. sthAlipAkA 2. ashtakai 3. anvashtakai 4. paarvaNi srArdhA
or sarpa bali 5. agrahAyaNi 6. Chaitri or EesAna bali
and (7) aswayuji . Most of them are done at home in 
GrihyAgni , which is the Agni in which the husband and 
wife perform their daily OupAsanam . We will not go into 
the details on the performance of these yaj~nAs here. 
<p>
The procedure for the paaka Yaj~nAs are described in Grihya sUtrAs
belonging to Smrithis . Hence , these Paaka Yaj~nAs are
referred to as SmArtha karmAs . These are thus distinct 
from Srautha karmAs ( Havir and sOma Yaj~nAs ) , since 
the latter derive their authority from Sruthis . It must be pointed out
that the SmArtha and Srautha karmAs are equal in importance .
<p>
<H3><a name="Havir_Yaj_nAs"></a>12. Havir Yaj~nAs</H3>

<p>
These are also seven in number and are a little more
elaborate in performance than paaka yaj~nAs . Their 
names are : 1. Agni aadhAnA 2. AgnihOthrA 3. darsa 
pUrNa maasa 4. AgrAyANaa 5. ChaathurmAsyaa
6. NiruDa pasubhandha and (7) SouthrAmaNi .
<p>
These yaj~nAs are performed in SroudhAgni , which is
also known as TrEtAgni . Aapasthampa sUtrAs in their 
trEthAgni khAndham (section ) give the details of construction 
of the Yaj~na kundAs and the maintenance of trEtAgnis or the 
three sroudhAgnis revered as gArhapathyam , dakshiNAgni
and aahavaneeyam .
<p>
<H3><a name="Soma_Yaj_nAs"></a>13. Soma Yaj~nAs</H3>

<p>
These are also seven in number . There are fewer hOmAs
in these sOma Yaj~nAs , but more eulogies or sthuthis ( sAma ghAnam ) .
SaamaVedidc recitation is central to these seven Yaj~nAs .
Saama Vedam has been identified as " VedAnAm
Saama vedOsmi " by GeethAchAryan . The four KhandAs 
of Saama Vedam ( AgnEya KhAnA , Aindra KhAndA ,
PaavamAna khAndhA and aaraNyaka KhandhA )
provide the sama riks or dashtis ( collection of ten
verses ) for the following seven sOma Yaj~nAs :
<p>
The individual names of these seven Yaj~nAs are :
<p>
1. AgnishtOmA or JyOthishtOmA 
2. AthyagnishtOmA 
3. UkthyA 4. ShOdasi 5. VaajabhEyA 
6. AthirAtrA and (7) abhthOryAmA 
<p>
One who completes a sOma yaj~nA is hailed as a
sOmayAji . Even if one can not do all of these
seven Yaj~nAs , it has been recommended that 
atleast one of the seven ( agnishthOmA ) should be
performed in one's life time .
<p>
<H3><a name="SanyAsins"></a>14. SanyAsins</H3>

<p>
For sanyAsins , there are no samskArA of cremation .
They are buried in BrindhAvanams by the riverside 
or enar a holy spot . A peepul sapling or TuLasi bush
is planted over the site . 
<p>
<H3><a name="Conclusion"></a>15. Conclusion </H3>

<p>
The importance of the samskArAs can not be underestimated
in the Hindu sanAtana dharmA . They from the core of the Hindu
life cycle rituals and guards the practioners from swerving into
paths not sanctioned by the VedAs . They protect them from the time
of conception to the last moment on this earth of our Lord . 
The samskArAs prescribed for the four successive/separate
aasramAs can not be abandoned until one's last breath.Through
the knowledge of these ancient samskArAs , it is our hope 
to incorporate them into our lives within the limits of our
abilities and help others keep up the tradition with Sriman
NaarAyaNA's krupA .
