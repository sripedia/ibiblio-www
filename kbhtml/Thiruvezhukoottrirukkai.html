Pari, when he dared to rob the Divya Dampathis for conducting his
Dadhiyaaraadhanam for Sri Vaishnavas.  The Divya Dampathis wanted to bless
their Special Bhaktha and appeared as a newly wed, rich couple decked with
precious jewellery.  Our Azhwar scouted them and surrounded them . He robbed
them and bundled all his loot . When he tried to lift the bundles containing
the proceeds of the robbery, he found them too heavy to lift. He then accused
the bridegroom that he had cast a spell through a Mantra.  Sriman Narayana
invited  Thirumangai to come closer so that he can share that  Mantram with
him. The Robber came close and into his right ear, Sriman Narayana gave the
upadesam on the AshtAkshara Mantram. The erstwhile robber received thus the
initiation from the Lord of the Universe Himself  and poured forth his ecstatic
experience in the form of majestic Pasurams of the First decad of the Periya
Thirumozhi.  He explained through those verses the greatness and the uniqueness
of the AshtAkshara Mantram to acheive the blessings of Moksham.
<p>
He went on an extended pilgrimage from one corner of India to the other and
gave us his Pasurams , which are expressions of his Bhagavad Anubhavam. He
composed a special work to celebrate the glory of the Lord of Thirukkudanthai,
Sri AarAvamudan known as Thiruvezhukurrirukkai (TVK).
<p>
I will comment on the highlights of this Composition . TVK is a poetry style
known as Ratha Bhandham or SabdhAlankaram.. ThiruJnanasambhandar (Mudal
Thirumarai-TevAram number 1464 ) and Arunagiri Nathar have composed works  in
the TVK style. Arunagiri Nathar"s work celebrates  the presiding Deity at Swami
Malai known as Swaminathan.  TVK is one long verse with 46  or 47 lines .
THirumangai"s TVK has 46 lines and Thirujnana Sambhandar's TVK has 47 lines.
Thirumangai"s TVK houses some of the salient metaphysical tenets of
VisishtAdvaita as it goes about offering its homage to the Lord of
Thirukkudanthai known also as SarangapAni.  The Azhwar was probably inspired by
the famous , gigantic Chittirai Ther (Temple Car) Of Sarangapani. He
constructed the TVK in the form of a Temple Car in Seven (Ezhu ) Decks ( Koorru
).  Irukkai stands for the ornamental pedestal at the center of this Ratham,
where the Lord is seated. The Azhwar is said to have the Darsanam of the Divya
Dampathis seated on the Chariot of Garuda , the Veda Swaroopan. 
<p>
The Ratha Bhandham (Construction/Binding) consists of the 
following pattern of seven Decks:
<p>
the 7th deck consists of 13 compartments
the 6th deck  has also 13 compartments(Penultimate)
the 5th deck has  11 compartemnts
the 4th deck has 9 compartments 
the 3rd deck has 7 compartments
the 2nd deck has 5 compartments
the first  deck has 3 compartments

in the pattern described below:

<p>
The above structure is indicative of the shape of a Ratham or a (temple) chariot
<p>
The deep meanings of the TVK of Thirumangai has been covered by Uttamur
Swamigal in his Commentaries.  Sri K.C.Varadachari'sBook on Alwars has few
pages of translation of the lines of TVK. Dr.V.K.S.N.Raghavan has a lengthy
article on TVK in the Volume 18 of the Indian Philosophical Annual of the years
1985-86.
<p>
Hence I will focus on the poetry aspects and very few references to the Tattvas
of Visishtadvaita here .
<p>
The lines 22to 28 and the lines from 29to 36 are useful to illustrate these
points. 
<p>
Part of line 22:  Ezhulahai Eyirrinil Kondanai (reference to the SEVEN ; O Lord
! you have lifted the 7 worlds on your tusks during your Varaha Avatara!)
<p>
Part of line 23: Kooriya Arusuvai Payanumaaiyanai : (Reference here is to the
SIX; As the scriptures declare, You are immanent in all objects and make them
all enjoyable like ARUSUVAI, the sixtet of tastes: Salty, Sour, Sweet, Bitter,
Astringent and Hot ; alternatively, your SIXFOLD noble attributes ,Viz.,
Wisdom, Power, Strength, Lordship, Valour and Splendour are indeed Parama
Bhogyam or most enjoyable).Upanishads declare the Lord as Annam to be enjoyed.
His Sakthi, Balam, Iswaryam, Veeryam, Tejas and Jnanam are the Six tasty
aspects as Annam .
<p>
Part of line 23/24 : Sudarvidum aimpadai angaiyul Amarndanai (Reference in this
line in the descending order from 7  to 6  are Number 5.. The FIVE blazing
weapons of the Lord on his Subasrayam (Auspicious Body), Viz., Sudarsanam,
Panchajanyam, Mace , Nandakam /sword, and Sarangam/bow are saluted here.  For
your devotees, you become Annam with 6 types of Tastes.For the others, who do
not appreciate your enjoyment and malign you, You wear and use the
Panchaayudams to corrrect them .  
<p>
Lines 24/25 : Sundara NArroL Munneer Vanna! --- Here the salutation centers on
aspects of the Lord using FOUR as the Number. Reference is to the four
beautiful arms of the Lord representing the aspect of giving as a boon the 4
Purushaarthaas (ChaturNAm PurusharthAnaam Dhata Deva: Chaturbhuja: according to
Appaya Dikshita ) ; He is also of the hue of the deep Blue Ocean . Here, the
Number 3 is incorporated with the salutation Munneer Vanna . Munneer stands for
Ocean made up of 3 Kinds of waters. 
<p>
Lines 25to 28: Ninneer adi Onriya ManatthAl (here the reference to the numbers
2 and 1; Lord's TWO feet are being pressed with ONE/Single- pointed mind by the
TWO Devis at the THREE divisions of Time , Sandhyas. You are resting thus in
Yoga Nidra. Lines 26 to 28 refer to  ONE, TWO and THREE this way: Oru Madi
Mukattu , Mangairuvarum Malarana Angaiyil Muppozhuthum Varuda Arituyil
amarnthanai.
<p>
Lines 29 to 36 ascend from FOUR to SVEN in the following manner:
<p>
Neri murai Naal Vahai Varunamumayinai, 
Metakum  Aim perum bhutamum niye!
Arupadam muralum koondal kaaranam
Ezhvidhai  Adanaga ccherranai, Aruvahai
Samayumum Arivaru Nilayinai, Aimpaal
Odhiyai akattu irruttinai. Aram Mudal
Naankavai-ay ,Moorthy Munrai 
iru vahai payan-ai , onru-ai virindu
Ninranai.
<p>
Here the the ascent is from 4 to 7 followed by the descent from 7 to 1 in six
steps. 
<p>
The 4 in the first line refers to the 4 Varnas outlined in Purusha Suktam(Naal
Vahai Varnamumayinai).  Pancha Bhoothas are referred to next : Aimperum
Bhothamum Niyeh .
<p>
Six and Seven are incorporated in the lines Arupadam Muralum--- Ezh Vidai
Adanga Ccherranai. For the sake of Nappinnai, whose natural fragrance of her
tresses are coveted by the SIX footed bees, you destroyed the SEVEN powerful
bulls in a contest and married her.
<p>
Hereafter, the lines of the TVK  descend from 7 to 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 and
end with one. 
<p>
Thirumangai starts with SIX by referring to the Six alien schools of thought
(Sankhya, Yoga,Nyaaya, Bauddha, Jaina et al ) not being able to comprehend the
glory of Sriman Narayana. Veda Bahya Schools or those that can not go beyond
Kaivalya  are included here as imperfect here.
<p>
Azhwar refers next to Five , when he states that the Lord has the Consort on
his chest and that  Maha Lakshmi has tresses with FIVE qualities: Black,
Length, Coolness ,Fragrance and softness. FOUR kinds of Purusharthas (Dharma,
Kama, Artha, Moksha ) follow next. THREE is included thereafter in  terms of
the Lord being the Antharyami of Indra, Brahma and Rudra. TWO fold fruit
(Aihika an dAamushmika ) Giving appears next.  In the beginning , You were the
Only ONE (Sat)  says the Aazhwar.
<p>
After completing the Ratha Bhandham , the Azhwar moves on to a direct prayer to
Aaraavamudhan in the following lines of TVK and concludes it with a description
of Thirukkudanthai and states that  the Holy feet of the Lord are  resting in
his mind always.
<p>
Thus ends the  great poem of the Azhwar, which is a testimony to his sharp
poetic skills and deep Bhakthi of Sriman Narayana.
<p>
Para Kaalan Thiruvadigale sharanam,
<p>
Oppiliappan Koil Varadachari Sadagopan.
