He is the author of <a href="/sripedia/kbhtml/Mahabharata.html" class=wikipagelink>Mahabharata</a> and the purANAs. It is this great sage, who classified  the vast vEdic lore into several sections according to their content and purpose. He is also the author of the VEdAntha sUtrAs (Brahma sUtrAs).He is considered as an incarnation  of Lord VishNu Himself on account of these stupendous achievements. 
<p>
Sri KrishNa DvipAyana VyAsA (as he is known ) was born in an illusrious family of great sages. He was the  great  grandson  of the famous Brahmarishi, VasishTA and the grand son of the sage Shakthi and the son of the eminent sage ParAsarA; latter  was  blessed  by VasishTA and PulasthyA and on account of their blessings, ParAsarA was  endowed  with  the  true  knowledge  of  the Supreme Reality. ParAsarA became the author of  VishNu  PurANam. VyAsA was born  of this great ParAsarA and Sathyavathi. VyAsA was called "DhvaipAyanA" since he was born on an island . He was also called 'KrishNa Dhvai- pAyanA ' since his complexion was dark.As he had his  hermitage in Badari kshEthram, he was also referred to as BAdarAyaNA. There  is vEdic reference to him as "SahOvaacha vyAasah pArAsaryah". 
<p>
The Skanda purANam refers to Veda VyAsA and  his achievements  and affirms  that  he alone  was  the author of the  VedAntha  sUtrAs. According to our tradiiton, it  is  an  undisputed  fact that Veda VyAsA was the classifier of the VedAs , author of the PurANAs  and the composer of MahA Bhaaratham and VedAntha sUtrAs. 
<p>
Sri vEdha VyAsA was a genius by birth. It is said that the   great sages Yaj~nyavalkyA initiated him into the  study  of  the  sacred lore and the other branches  of  knowledge. VyAsA  resorted to the quiet realms of the HimAlayAs (BadarikAsramam) and by  performance of rigorous penance and austerities, he realized the Supreme Truth eulogized in the VedAs and Upanishads. 
<p>
The VishNu purANam describes (3.3)elaborately how Lord MahA VishNu incarnates Himself in the form of  VyAsA and classifies the vEdhAs during each DhvApara Yugam. The vEdhA was all in one mass, &amp;people were not able to imbibe the teachings of the vEdAs.  For the  good of the people, VyAsA classified the vEdhic lore. The VishNu purANA mentions that this kind of classification was effected 28 times by the Lord in the form of VyAsA.  ParAsarA's son,  Sri  KrishNa Dhva- ipAyanA is one of those VyAsAs and it is believed that the  son of DhrONA would become the next VyAsA. The  status of VyAsA is thus a very exalted one. 
<p>
Sri KrishNa DhvaipAyana VyAsA took an active part in the events of MahA BhAratham (MB). The heroes of MB such as BhIshmA, DhritharAsh -trA, Sri KrishNA, DharmarAyA &amp;  others held VyAsA in great esteem. VyAsA advised the scions of the Kuru race to  follow  the  path of DharmA.  The  MB  was  authored by VyAsA for the good of humanity. VyAsA taught the truth in  MB  that  glory  and  honour  could  be achieved by the One imbibing and  practising  the cardinal virtues of life. He has illustrated this truth by means of the  stories of VidhurA, DharmavyAdhe, TulAdharA  and others. 
<p>
The greatest  achievement  of  Veda   VyAsA   was  the  collection, consolidation and classification of  the  Vedic lore. It was VyAsA, who brought about the different divisions of the Vedic lore as the four SamhithAs, the BrahmaNAs,  the  AraNyakAs and  the Upanishads. The different texts required for the different classes  of priests, such as the Riks, the Yajus , the SAmans  and  the  Atharvans were separately codified by this great Master. VishNu PurANam says that VyAsA accepted 4  disciples &amp; taught each one of them a particular VedhA. He taught Rig VedhA to PailA, Yajur vEdhA  to  VaismpAyanA, SAma VEdhA to Jaimini &amp; the Atharva VedhA to Sumanthu; further, he taught the PurANAs to RomaharshaNA. The clasification of the VedhA was accomplished by VyAsA and later the different branches and sub branches (SAkhAs) evolved for each VedhA over the course of time. 
<p>
Srimadh BhAgavatham (SB)describes that the Lord was born as  VyAsA as the seventeenth avathArA for the purpose of dividing  the  tree of VedAs into its many branches. 
<p>
SB describes how Veda VyAsA was overcome by frustration inspite of the fact that he had engaged himself whole heartedly for advancing the good of the people for years and  years.  He  felt  uneasy  at heart and when he began to reflect  with  discomfort that his work was not completed, sage NAradhA  called on him and  advised  VyAsA to sing solely on the glory of the  Lord  to overcome this mood of depression. Following Sage NAradhA's counsel, VyAsA  composed Sri- madh BhAgavatham and taught it to his son, Sukha Brahmam. 
<p>
The MahA BharathA describes how at one time  even this great VyAsA felt that his words of wisdom (upadEsams)were not heeded by anyone. He said "I am shouting at the  top  of my voice, with both my arms lifted up, that DahrmA alone leads One  to all auspiciousness here and in the hereafter. But alas ! no one listens to me!". 
<p>
Sri vEdha VyAsA is an illustrious seer and a great exponent of the cultural heritage of India.  We  depend on  him  for  gaining  the wisdom from the VedAs, IthihAsAs  and  PurANAs  and the  knowledge about the Supreme Reality. VyAsA is the  author  of  this  eternal message: "Victory is there, where there is DharmA". The foundation of the Indian culture rooted in the VedAs has been  laid firmly by him for all the world to follow.
