the worlds, nay, the very thought crossing the minds of everyone, the one to be cognized
through the vedas, the knower of all dharmas, the one who enhances the fame of the worlds,
the great one, the cause of all existence, such a worshipper tides over all the sorrows of the world.

Hear from me, O king ! the thousand names of Lord Vishnu, the dispeller of the fear of sin, the

with all its contents (things and beings) rests.

The great veda vyasa is the rishi of these thousand names of vishnu, 'Anustup' is its meter, the presiding
deity is devaki's son, the seed (bijam) is &quot;the one born in the lunar race&quot;, its power is &quot;the darling of
devaki&quot; it's heart (hrdayam) is the name &quot;one who is lauded by the three sAma hymns&quot;, and its purpose is
the attainment of peace.

the wind as his breath, the Sun and the moon as his eyes, the directions as his ears and the heavens as
his head, fire his face and the ocean his abdomen. In him is embodied the universe, with the diverse
things and beings of different genre, the gods, humans, birds, cattle, serpents (birds and beasts), the
gandharvas and daityas (asuras) - all sporting in a charming way.

Salutations to Lord Visnu, peace personified, residing on the serpent couch (Adisesa). From his navel
sprouts a lotus. He is the overlord of the celestials. The universe is but his form. He resembles the
sky and has the complexion of the clouds, with graceful limbs (of exquisite charm and perfect symmetry)
He is the consort of Laksmi. His eyes are like lotus. He resides in the heart region of the yogis
steeped in loving contemplation. He dispels (destroys) the dread of samsara. He is the peerless Lord
of the universe, the supreme monarch.
